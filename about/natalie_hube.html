        As part of my research, I focus on the usage of human representations in Virtual & Augmented Reality for
        international collaboration.
        Further areas of research interest include HCI, information visualization, and computer graphics.
        I am a PhD student at Mercedes-Benz AG, Virtual Reality Center, in Stuttgart and am supervised by the
        University of Stuttgart, VISUS, Chair of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.
