# TODO

- add link to video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvvx-IrJpXM
- Allow hosting video somewhere else
- Allow arbitrary file endings, as long as base name equals publication key, especially for images and videos

## Maybe

- separate about, people, publications into different pages
- add page for news once we have some
  - add link to video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvvx-IrJpXM
- add social media once we have some
- Allow multiple videos
- Add page with paper/author vis, in another repo
  - timeline dotplot with teaser images and colored border for conference/journal
  - interactive filters
  - maybe similar to paper explorers for surves, such as [timevizbrowser](https://browser.timeviz.net/)
