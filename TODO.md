# TODO

- add link to video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvvx-IrJpXM
- Allow hosting video somewhere else
- Allow arbitrary file endings, as long as base name equals publication key, especially for images and videos
- replace special characters such as & in title, journal, etc
- add venues.js with info about conferences and journals, allows adding titles and links to venue for each pub

## Maybe

- Allow multiple videos, supplementals, ...
- Add page with paper/author vis, maybe in another repo
- format bibtex into different styles using https://github.com/enric1994/bibtexonline
  - can be done just by adding a link to this page
