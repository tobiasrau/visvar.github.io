# TODO

- separate about, people, publications into different pages
- add page for news?
- add link to video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvvx-IrJpXM
- Allow arbitrary file endings, as long as base name equals publication key, especially for images and videos
- replace special characters such as & in title, journal, etc
- add venues.js with info about conferences and journals, allows adding titles and links to venue for each pub

## Maybe

- Allow multiple videos
- Add page with paper/author vis, maybe in another repo
  - timeline dotplot with teaser images and colored border for conference/journal
  - interactive filters
