When it comes to Human-Robot Collaboration(HRC), training and safety are important aspects that can be supported by simulators. In this demo, we propose a workflow between ROS and a VR application that allows the use of real robot programming plans to control the robot’s digital twin. We also provide the results of a short evaluation that was done with 6 experts, where they provided insights for future improvement and use cases. Our demo is the first step towards a full integrated system where path planning and fabrication steps can be tested with users without any of the risk and cost that are involved when using real industrial robots.</div>
