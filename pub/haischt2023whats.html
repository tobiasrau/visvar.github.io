However, often there is a lack of stable tracking solutions when used inside manufacturing environments. Many different tracking technologies are available, yet, it can be difficult to choose the most appropriate tracking solution for different use cases with their varying conditions. In order to shed light on common tracking requirements and conditions for automotive AR use cases we conducted a use case study spanning 61 use cases within the complete product life-cycle of a large automotive manufacturer. By analyzing the gathered data we were able to note the frequency of different tracking requirements and conditions within automotive AR use cases. Based on these use cases we could also derive common factors of influence for AR tracking in the automotive industry, which show the various challenges automotive AR tracking is currently facing.</div>
