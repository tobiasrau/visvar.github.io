To provide better support for that, we define requirements for text input methods that target situated visualization authoring. We identify wearable chorded keyboards as a potentially suitable method that fulfills some of these requirements. To further investigate this approach, we tailored a chorded keyboard device to visualization authoring, developed a learning application, and conducted a pilot user study. Our results confirm that learning a high number of chords is the main barrier for adoption, as in other application areas. Based on that, we discuss ideas on how chorded keyboards with a strongly reduced alphabet, hand gestures, and voice recognition might be used as a viable, multi-modal support for authoring situated visualizations in-situ.</div>
