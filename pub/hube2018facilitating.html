Although visitors generally are informed about the topic before a visit, interests are still difficult to extract from the mass of exhibition stands and offers. In this paper we describe a concept using head-coupled AR together with recommender mechanisms for exhibitions. We present a conceptual development for a first prototype with focus on navigational aspects as well as explicit and implicit recommendations to generate input data for visually displayed recommendations.</div>
