      My research focuses on visualization for dimensionality reduction, especially the comparison between
      different techniques.
      I developed and maintain two open source JavaScript libraries for dimensionality reduction
      (<a href="https://github.com/saehm/DruidJS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DruidJS</a>) and scatterplot gridification
      (<a href="https://github.com/saehm/hagrid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hagrid</a>).
      Besides more serious research, I occasionally explore ways to create <a

    I conduct research on visualization for and with machine learning, mainly to support non experts in using and developing new machine learning models.
    Currently, I am working on the topic of music composition and how AI and visualization can enhance the human instead of replacing it.
      One of the answers is: Using a human centered, AI-assisted approach with visualization as efficient communication between human and AI.
      At the start I focus only on monophonic melody composition.
      Later I want to expand my research to other steps in the composition process, machine learning pipeline, and human-AI interaction to foster the human creativity, music writing,
      and bring AI to non expert people.

      I have worked as a Data Scientist in an inter-disciplinary environment, working in close collaboration with social scientists, journalists, and geo-political experts on tasks such as sentiment and stance detection, analyzing the propagation of fake news and language traits (toxicity and hate speech) among social media users, to name a few. I am interested in exploratory data analysis in a multi-modal setting which can be adapted across domains and organizations to foster healthier working environments.
