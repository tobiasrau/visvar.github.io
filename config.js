      My research focuses on the accessible design of VR for people with visual impairments.
      In the context of social VR spaces, I try to make non-verbal signals (e.g., eye contact, facial expressions, and gestures) perceivable during a conversation in VR for people with visual impairments via other sensory modalities.
      Of course, the substituted non-verbal signals must always be adapted to the context and be unobtrusive so that they do not override other sensory modalities of people with visual impairment in a conversation.
      This requires a user-centric approach to develop usable solutions.
      The overall goal of my research is always to increase the accessibility of VR.
