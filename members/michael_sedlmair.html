                We investigate how Mixed Reality (MR) can be used to guide human body motions, such as in physiotherapy, dancing, or workout applications. While first MR prototypes have shown promising results, many dimensions of the design space behind such applications remain largely unexplored. To better understand this design space, we approach the topic from different angles by contributing three user studies. In particular, we take a closer look at the influence of the perspective, the characteristics of motions, and visual guidance on different user performance measures. Our results indicate that a first-person perspective performs best for all visible motions, whereas the type of visual instruction plays a minor role. From our results we compile a set of considerations that can guide future work on the design of instructions, evaluations, and the technical setup of MR motion guidance systems.

                We present a user study comparing a pre-evaluated mapping approach with a state-of-the-art direct mapping method of facial expressions for emotion judgment in an immersive setting. At its heart, the pre-evaluated approach leverages semiotics, a theory used in linguistic. In doing so, we want to compare pre-evaluation with an approach that seeks to directly map real facial expressions onto their virtual counterparts. To evaluate both approaches, we conduct a controlled lab study with 22 participants. The results show that users are significantly more accurate in judging virtual facial expressions with pre-evaluated mapping. Additionally, participants were slightly more confident when deciding on a presented emotion. We could not find any differences regarding potential Uncanny Valley effects. However, the pre-evaluated mapping shows potential to be more convenient in a conversational scenario.

                Musicians mostly have to rely on their ears when they want to analyze what they play, for example to detect errors. Since hearing is sequential, it is not possible to quickly grasp an overview over one or multiple recordings of a whole piece of music at once. We therefore propose various visualizations that allow analyzing errors and stylistic variance. Our current approach focuses on rhythm and uses MIDI data for simplicity.

                Among the many changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most pressing for scientific research concerns user testing. For the researchers who conduct studies with human participants, the requirements for social distancing have created a need for reflecting on methodologies that previously seemed relatively straightforward. It has become clear from the emerging literature on the topic and from first-hand experiences of researchers that the restrictions due to the pandemic affect every aspect of the research pipeline. The current paper offers an initial reflection on user-based research, drawing on the authors' own experiences and on the results of a survey that was conducted among researchers in different disciplines, primarily psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization communities. While this sampling of researchers is by no means comprehensive, the multi-disciplinary approach and the consideration of different aspects of the research pipeline allow us to examine current and future challenges for user-based research. Through an exploration of these issues, this paper also invites others in the VIS-as well as in the wider-research community, to reflect on and discuss the ways in which the current crisis might also present new and previously unexplored opportunities.

                Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.

                We propose ClaVis, a visual analytics system for comparative analysis of classification models. ClaVis allows users to visually compare the performance and behavior of tens to hundreds of classifiers trained with different hyperparameter configurations. Our approach is plugin-based and classifier-agnostic and allows users to add their own datasets and classifier implementations. It provides multiple visualizations, including a multivariate ranking, a similarity map, a scatterplot that reveals correlations between parameters and scores, and a training history chart. We demonstrate the effectivity of our approach in multiple case studies for training classification models in the domain of natural language processing.

abstract = {We propose ClaVis, a visual analytics system for comparative analysis of classification
models. ClaVis allows users to visually compare the performance and behavior of tens
to hundreds of classifiers trained with different hyperparameter configurations. Our
approach is plugin-based and classifier-agnostic and allows users to add their own
datasets and classifier implementations. It provides multiple visualizations, including
a multivariate ranking, a similarity map, a scatterplot that reveals correlations
between parameters and scores, and a training history chart. We demonstrate the effectivity
of our approach in multiple case studies for training classification models in the
domain of natural language processing.},

                With the growing interest in Immersive Analytics, there is also a need for novel and suitable input modalities for such applications. We explore eye tracking, head tracking, hand motion tracking, and data gloves as input methods for a 2D tracing task and compare them to touch input as a baseline in an exploratory user study (N= 20). We compare these methods in terms of user experience, workload, accuracy, and time required for input. The results show that the input method has a significant influence on these measured variables. While touch input surpasses all other input methods in terms of user experience, workload, and accuracy, eye tracking shows promise in respect of the input time. The results form a starting point for future research investigating input methods.

                We introduce AVAR, a prototypical implementation of an agile situated visualization (SV) toolkit targeting liveness, integration, and expressiveness. We report on results of an exploratory study with AVAR and seven expert users. In it, participants wore a Microsoft HoloLens device and used a Bluetooth keyboard to program a visualization script for a given dataset. To support our analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users' interactions, and (iii) collected data of participants' impressions. Our prototype confirms that agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.

                Subtitles play a crucial role in cross-lingual distribution of multimedia content and help communicate information where auditory content is not feasible (loud environments, hearing impairments, unknown languages). Established methods utilize text at the bottom of the screen, which may distract from the video. Alternative techniques place captions closer to related content (e.g., faces) but are not applicable to arbitrary videos such as documentations. Hence, we propose to leverage live gaze as indirect input method to adapt captions to individual viewing behavior. We implemented two gaze-adaptive methods and compared them in a user study (n=54) to traditional captions and audio-only videos. The results show that viewers with less experience with captions prefer our gaze-adaptive methods as they assist them in reading. Furthermore, gaze distributions resulting from our methods are closer to natural viewing behavior compared to the traditional approach. Based on these results, we provide design implications for gaze-adaptive captions.

                Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that encode 2D density distributions using color or brightness. Experimental studies have shown though that both of these visual variables are inaccurate when reading and comparing numeric data values. A potential remedy might be to use 3D heatmaps by introducing height as a third dimension to encode the data. Encoding abstract data in 3D, however, poses many problems, too. To better understand this tradeoff, we conducted an empirical study (N=48) to evaluate the user performance of 2D and 3D heatmaps for comparative analysis tasks. We test our conditions on a conventional 2D screen, but also in a virtual reality environment to allow for real stereoscopic vision. Our main results show that 3D heatmaps are superior in terms of error rate when reading and comparing single data items. However, for overview tasks, the well-established 2D heatmap performs better.
