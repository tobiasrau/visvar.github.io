      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this article, we discuss how Visualization (VIS) with Machine Learning (ML) could mutually benefit from each other. We do so through the lens of our own experience working at this intersection for the last decade. Particularly we focus on describing how VIS supports explaining ML models and aids ML-based Dimensionality Reduction techniques in solving tasks such as parameter space analysis. In the other direction, we discuss approaches showing how ML helps improve VIS, such as applying ML-based automation to improve visualization design. Based on the examples and our own perspective, we describe a number of open research challenges that we frequently encountered in our endeavors to combine ML and VIS.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Immersive analytics often takes place in virtual environments which promise the users immersion. To fulfill this promise, sensory feedback, such as haptics, is an important component, which is however not well supported yet. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our prototype through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality. Additionally, we conducted a second user study in the field of immersive visualization to investigate the potential benefits of PropellerHand there.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We propose a 3D immersive visualization environment for analyzing the right hand movements of a cello player. To achieve this, we track the position and orientation of the cello bow and record audio. As movements mostly occur in a shallow volume and the motion is therefore mostly two-dimensional, we use the third dimension to encode time. Our concept further explores various mappings from motion and audio data to spatial and other visual attributes. We work in close cooperation with a cellist and plan to evaluate our prototype through a user study with a group of cellists in the near future.</div>

Inspired by life logging and fitness tracking, we imagine musicians to record their practice sessions over the span of months or years. The resulting data in the form of MIDI or audio recordings can then be analyzed sporadically to track progress and guide decisions. Toward this vision, we started exploring various visualization designs together with a group of nine guitarists, who provided us with data and feedback over the course of three months.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Virtual avatars are widely used for collaborating in virtual environments. Yet, often these avatars lack expressiveness to determine a state of mind. Prior work has demonstrated efective usage of determining emotions and animated lip movement through analyzing mere audio tracks of spoken words. To provide this information on a virtual avatar, we created a natural audio data set consisting of 17 audio fles from which we then extracted the underlying emotion and lip movement. To conduct a pilot study, we developed a prototypical system that displays the extracted visual parameters and then maps them on a virtual avatar while playing the corresponding audio fle. We tested the system with 5 participants in two conditions: (i) while seeing the virtual avatar only an audio fle was played. (ii) In addition to the audio fle, the extracted facial visual parameters were displayed on the virtual avatar. Our results suggest the validity of using additional visual parameters in the avatars face as it helps to determine emotions. We conclude with a brief discussion on the outcomes and their implications on future work.</div>

abstract = { Virtual avatars are widely used for collaborating in virtual environments. Yet, often these avatars lack expressiveness to determine a state of mind. Prior work has demonstrated effective usage of determining emotions and animated lip movement through analyzing mere audio tracks of spoken words. To provide this information on a virtual avatar, we created a natural audio data set consisting of 17 audio files from which we then extracted the underlying emotion and lip movement. To conduct a pilot study, we developed a prototypical system that displays the extracted visual parameters and then maps them on a virtual avatar while playing the corresponding audio file. We tested the system with 5 participants in two conditions: (i) while seeing the virtual avatar only an audio file was played. (ii) In addition to the audio file, the extracted facial visual parameters were displayed on the virtual avatar. Our results suggest the validity of using additional visual parameters in the avatars’ face as it helps to determine emotions. We conclude with a brief discussion on the outcomes and their implications on future work.},

The study is based on 1,710 images sampled from a visualization dataset (VIS30K) over five years. We simulated four CVDs on each image. First, four researchers (one with a CVD) identified existing issues and helpful aspects in a subset of the images. Based on the resulting labels, 200 crowdworkers provided  30,000 ratings on present CVD issues in the simulated images. We analyzed this data for correlations, clusters, trends, and free text comments to gain a first overview of paper figure accessibility. Overall, about 60 % of the images were rated accessible. Furthermore, our study indicates that accessibility issues are subjective and hard to detect.

Targeting at chemistry education, our goal is to make virtual molecule structures more tangible. Results of an initial user study indicate that the VR molecular construction kit was positively received. Compared to a physical construction kit, the VR molecular construction kit is on the same level in terms of natural interaction. Besides, it fosters the typical digital advantages though, such as saving, exporting, and sharing of molecules. Feedback from the study participants has also revealed potential future avenues for tangible molecule visualizations. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present RagRug, an open-source toolkit for situated analytics. The abilities of RagRug go beyond previous immersive analytics toolkits by focusing on specific requirements emerging when using augmented reality (AR) rather than virtual reality. RagRug combines state of the art visual encoding capabilities with a comprehensive physical-virtual model, which lets application developers systematically describe the physical objects in the real world and their role in AR. We connect AR visualization with data streams from the Internet of Things using distributed dataflow. To this aim, we use reactive programming patterns so that visualizations become context-aware, i.e., they adapt to events coming in from the environment. The resulting authoring system is low-code; it emphasises describing the physical and the virtual world and the dataflow between the elements contained therein. We describe the technical design and implementation of RagRug, and report on five example applications illustrating the toolkit's abilities.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We propose a visual approach for AI-assisted music composition, where the user interactively generates, selects, and adapts short melodies. Based on an entered start melody, we automatically generate multiple continuation samples. Repeating this step and in turn generating continuations for these samples results in a tree or graph of melodies. We visualize this structure with two visualizations, where nodes display the piano roll of the corresponding sample. By interacting with these visualizations, the user can quickly listen to, choose, and adapt melodies, to iteratively create a composition. A third visualization provides an overview over larger numbers of samples, allowing for insights into the AI's predictions and the sample space.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Collaboration is essential in companies and often physical presence is required, thus, more and more Virtual Reality (VR) systems are used to work together remotely. To support social interaction, human representations in form of avatars are used in collaborative virtual environment (CVE) tools. However, up to now, the avatar representations often are limited in their design and functionality, which may hinder effective collaboration. In our interview study, we explored the status quo of VR collaboration in a large automotive company setting with a special focus on the role of avatars. We collected inter-view data from 21 participants, from which we identified challenges of current avatar representations used in our setting. Based on these findings, we discuss design suggestions for avatars in a company setting, which aim to improve social interaction. As opposed to state-of-the-art research, we found that users within the context of a large automotive company have an altered need with respect to avatar representations.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a popular technique that is often used in Machine Learning and Visualization communities to analyze high-dimensional data. The approach is empirically proven to be powerful for uncovering previously unseen structures in the data. While observing the results of the intermediate optimization steps of DR algorithms, we coincidently discovered the artistic beauty of the DR process. With enthusiasm for the beauty, we decided to look at DR from a generative art lens rather than their technical application aspects and use DR techniques to create artwork. Particularly, we use the optimization process to generate images, by drawing each intermediate step of the optimization process with some opacity over the previous intermediate result. As another alternative input, we used a neural-network model for face-landmark detection, to apply DR to portraits, while maintaining some facial properties, resulting in abstracted facial avatars. In this work, we provide such a collection of such artwork.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In visual interactive labeling, users iteratively assign labels to data items until the machine model reaches an acceptable accuracy. A crucial step of this process is to inspect the model’s accuracy and decide whether it is necessary to label additional elements. In scenarios with no or very little labeled data, visual inspection of the predictions is required. Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation. We found that users outperform traditional automated approaches when estimating a model’s accuracy. Furthermore, while the complexity of images impacts the overall performance, the layout of the items in the plot has little to no effect on estimations.</div>

Yet, these devices are still rarely used in practice and it remains an open challenge how to move this research into practice. To that end, we contribute a participatory design study on the use of haptic feedback devices in the automotive industry. Based on a 10-month observing process with 13 engineers, we developed STRIVE, a string-based haptic feedback device. In addition to the design of STRIVE, this process led to a set of requirements for introducing haptic devices into industrial settings, which center around a need for flexibility regarding forces, comfort, and mobility. We evaluated STRIVE with 16 engineers in five different day-to-day automotive VR use cases. The main results show an increased level of trust and perceived safety as well as further challenges towards moving haptics research into practice. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this design study, we present IRVINE, a Visual Analytics (VA) system, which facilitates the analysis of acoustic data to detect and understand previously unknown errors in the manufacturing of electrical engines. In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Immersive analytics is a fast growing field that is often applied in virtual reality (VR). VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">A common enhancement of scatterplots represents points as small multiples, glyphs, or thumbnail images. As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The world is still under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though vaccines are deployed as rapidly as possible, it is still necessary to use other measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Measures such as social distancing or wearing a mask receive a lot of criticism. Therefore, we want to demonstrate a serious game to help the players understand these measures better and show them why they are still necessary. The player of the game has to avoid other agents to keep their risk of a COVID-19 infection low. The game uses Virtual Reality through a Head-Mounted-Display to deliver an immersive and enjoyable experience. Gamification elements are used to engage the user with the game while they explore various environments. We also implemented visualizations that help the user with social distancing.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The logos of metal bands can be by turns gaudy, uncouth, or nearly illegible. Yet, these logos work: they communicate sophisticated notions of genre and emotional affect. In this paper we use the design considerations of metal logos to explore the space of “illegible semantics”: the ways that text can communicate information at the cost of readability, which is not always the most important objective. In this work, drawing on formative visualization theory, professional design expertise, and empirical assessments of a corpus ofmetal band logos, we describe a design space of metal logos and present a tool through which logo characteristics can be explored through visualization. We investigate ways in which logo designers imbue their text with meaning and consider opportunities and implications for visualization more widely.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Strategies for selecting the next data instance to label, in service of generating labeled data for machine learning, have been considered separately in the machine learning literature on active learning and in the visual analytics literature on human-centered approaches. We propose a unified design space for instance selection strategies to support detailed and fine-grained analysis covering both of these perspectives. We identify a concise set of 15 properties, namely measureable characteristics of datasets or of machine learning models applied to them, that cover most of the strategies in these literatures. To quantify these properties, we introduce Property Measures (PM) as fine-grained building blocks that can be used to formalize instance selection strategies. In addition, we present a taxonomy of PMs to support the description, evaluation, and generation of PMs across four dimensions: machine learning (ML) Model Output, Instance Relations, Measure Functionality, and Measure Valence. We also create computational infrastructure to support qualitative visual data analysis: a visual analytics explainer for PMs built around an implementation of PMs using cascades of eight atomic functions. It supports eight analysis tasks, covering the analysis of datasets and ML models using visual comparison within and between PMs and groups of PMs, and over time during the interactive labeling process. We iteratively refined the PM taxonomy, the explainer, and the task abstraction in parallel with each other during a two-year formative process, and show evidence of their utility through a summative evaluation with the same infrastructure. This research builds a formal baseline for the better understanding of the commonalities and differences of instance selection strategies, which can serve as the stepping stone for the synthesis of novel strategies in future work.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In recent years, research on immersive environments has experienced a new wave of interest, and immersive analytics has been established as a new research field. Every year, a vast amount of different techniques, applications, and user studies are published that focus on employing immersive environments for visualizing and analyzing data. Nevertheless, immersive analytics is still a relatively unexplored field that needs more basic research in many aspects and is still viewed with skepticism. Rightly so, because in our opinion, many researchers do not fully exploit the possibilities offered by immersive environments and, on the contrary, sometimes even overestimate the power of immersive visualizations. Although a growing body of papers has demonstrated individual advantages of immersive analytics for specific tasks and problems, the general benefit of using immersive environments for effective analytic tasks remains controversial. In this article, we reflect on when and how immersion may be appropriate for the analysis and present four guiding scenarios. We report on our experiences, discuss the landscape of assessment strategies, and point out the directions where we believe immersive visualizations have the greatest potential.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Visual quality measures (VQMs) are designed to support analysts by automatically detecting and quantifying patterns in visualizations. We propose a new data-driven technique called ClustRank that allows to rank scatterplots according to visible grouping patterns. Our model first encodes scatterplots in the parametric space of a Gaussian Mixture Model, and then uses a classifier trained on human judgment data to estimate the perceptual complexity of grouping patterns. The numbers of initial mixture components and final combined groups determine the rank of the scatterplot. ClustRank improves on existing VQM techniques by mimicking human judgments on two-Gaussian cluster patterns and gives more accuracy when ranking general cluster patterns in scatterplots. We demonstrate its benefit by analyzing kinship data for genome-wide association studies, a domain in which experts rely on the visual analysis of large sets of scatterplots. We make the three benchmark datasets and the ClustRank VQM available for practical use and further improvements. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present document domain randomization (DDR), the first successful transfer of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained only on graphically rendered pseudo-paper pages to real-world document segmentation. DDR renders pseudo-document pages by modeling randomized textual and non-textual contents of interest, with user-defined layout and font styles to support joint learning of fine-grained classes. We demonstrate competitive results using our DDR approach to extract nine document classes from the benchmark CS-150 and papers published in two domains, namely annual meetings of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and IEEE Visualization (VIS). We compare DDR to conditions of style mismatch, fewer or more noisy samples that are more easily obtained in the real world. We show that high-fidelity semantic information is not necessary to label semantic classes but style mismatch between train and test can lower model accuracy. Using smaller training samples had a slightly detrimental effect. Finally, network models still achieved high test accuracy when correct labels are diluted towards confusing labels; this behavior hold across several classes. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">A plethora of dimensionality reduction techniques have emerged over the past decades, leaving researchers and analysts with a wide variety of choices for reducing their data, all the more so given some techniques come with additional parametrization (e.g. t-SNE, UMAP, etc.). Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D projections is usually qualitatively decided, by setting projections side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which projection is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating projections, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select 'good' and 'misleading' views between scatterplots of low-level projections of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select projections. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between projections. With this proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank projections on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity in projections selected.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Class separation is an important concept in machine learning and visual analytics. We address the visual analysis of class separation measures for both high-dimensional data and its corresponding projections into 2D through dimensionality reduction (DR) methods. Although a plethora of separation measures have been proposed, it is difficult to compare class separation between multiple datasets with different characteristics, multiple separation measures, and multiple DR methods. We present ProSeCo, an interactive visualization approach to support comparison between up to 20 class separation measures and up to 4 DR methods, with respect to any of 7 dataset characteristics: dataset size, dataset dimensions, class counts, class size variability, class size skewness, outlieriness, and real-world vs. synthetically generated data. ProSeCo supports (1) comparing across measures, (2) comparing high-dimensional to dimensionally-reduced 2D data across measures, (3) comparing between different DR methods across measures, (4) partitioning with respect to a dataset characteristic, (5) comparing partitions for a selected characteristic across measures, and (6) inspecting individual datasets in detail. We demonstrate the utility of ProSeCo in two usage scenarios, using datasets [1] posted at https://osf.io/epcf9/.</div>

VIS30K's comprehensive coverage of the scientific literature in visualization not only reflects the progress of the field but also enables researchers to study the evolution of the state-of-the-art and to find relevant work based on graphical content. We describe the dataset and our semi-automatic collection process, which couples convolutional neural networks (CNN) with curation. Extracting figures and tables semi-automatically allows us to verify that no images are overlooked or extracted erroneously. To improve quality further, we engaged in a peer-search process for high-quality figures from early IEEE Visualization papers. With the resulting data, we also contribute VISImageNavigator (VIN, visimagenavigator.github.io ), a web-based tool that facilitates searching and exploring VIS30K by author names, paper keywords, title and abstract, and years.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Many professionals, like journalists, writers, or consultants, need to acquire information from various sources, make sense of this unstructured evidence, structure their observations, and finally create and deliver their product, such as a report or a presentation. In formative interviews, we found that tools allowing structuring of observations are often disconnected from the corresponding evidence. Therefore, we designed a sensemaking environment with a flexible observation graph that visually ties together evidence in unstructured documents with the user’s structured knowledge. This is achieved through bi-directional deep links between highlighted document portions and nodes in the observation graph. In a controlled study, we compared users’ sensemaking strategies using either the observation graph or a simple text editor on a large display. Results show that the observation graph represents a holistic, compact representation of users’ observations, which can be linked to unstructured evidence on demand. In contrast, users taking textual notes required much more display space to spatially organize source documents containing unstructured evidence. This implies that spatial organization is a powerful strategy to structure observations even if the available space is limited.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Movement-compensating interactions like teleportation are commonly deployed techniques in virtual reality environments. Although practical, they tend to cause disorientation while navigating. Previous studies show the effectiveness of orientation-supporting tools, such as trails, in reducing such disorientation and reveal different strengths and weaknesses of individual tools. However, to date, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of those tools when teleportation is used as a movement-compensating technique, in particular under consideration of different tasks. In this paper, we compare the effects of three orientation-supporting tools, namely minimap, trail, and heatmap. We conducted a quantitative user study with 48 participants to investigate the accuracy and efficiency when executing four exploration and search tasks. As dependent variables, task performance, completion time, space coverage, amount of revisiting, retracing time, and memorability were measured. Overall, our results indicate that orientation-supporting tools improve task completion times and revisiting behavior. The trail and heatmap tools were particularly useful for speed-focused tasks, minimal revisiting, and space coverage. The minimap increased memorability and especially supported retracing tasks. These results suggest that virtual reality systems should provide orientation aid tailored to the specific tasks of the users.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present a systematic review of 45S papers that report on evaluations in mixed and augmented reality (MR/AR) published in ISMAR, CHI, IEEE VR, and UIST over a span of 11 years (2009-2019). Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-thewild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis. A majority (216/248) of user studies are conducted in a laboratory setting. Often (138/248), such studies involve participants in a static way. However, we also found a fair number (30/248) of in-the-wild studies that involve participants in a mobile fashion. We consider this paper to be relevant to academia and industry alike in presenting the state-of-the-art and guiding the steps to designing, conducting, and analyzing results of evaluations in MR/AR.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present a user study comparing a pre-evaluated mapping approach with a state-of-the-art direct mapping method of facial expressions for emotion judgment in an immersive setting. At its heart, the pre-evaluated approach leverages semiotics, a theory used in linguistic. In doing so, we want to compare pre-evaluation with an approach that seeks to directly map real facial expressions onto their virtual counterparts. To evaluate both approaches, we conduct a controlled lab study with 22 participants. The results show that users are significantly more accurate in judging virtual facial expressions with pre-evaluated mapping. Additionally, participants were slightly more confident when deciding on a presented emotion. We could not find any differences regarding potential Uncanny Valley effects. However, the pre-evaluated mapping shows potential to be more convenient in a conversational scenario.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We investigate how Mixed Reality (MR) can be used to guide human body motions, such as in physiotherapy, dancing, or workout applications. While first MR prototypes have shown promising results, many dimensions of the design space behind such applications remain largely unexplored. To better understand this design space, we approach the topic from different angles by contributing three user studies. In particular, we take a closer look at the influence of the perspective, the characteristics of motions, and visual guidance on different user performance measures. Our results indicate that a first-person perspective performs best for all visible motions, whereas the type of visual instruction plays a minor role. From our results we compile a set of considerations that can guide future work on the design of instructions, evaluations, and the technical setup of MR motion guidance systems.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Among the many changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most pressing for scientific research concerns user testing. For the researchers who conduct studies with human participants, the requirements for social distancing have created a need for reflecting on methodologies that previously seemed relatively straightforward. It has become clear from the emerging literature on the topic and from first-hand experiences of researchers that the restrictions due to the pandemic affect every aspect of the research pipeline. The current paper offers an initial reflection on user-based research, drawing on the authors' own experiences and on the results of a survey that was conducted among researchers in different disciplines, primarily psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization communities. While this sampling of researchers is by no means comprehensive, the multi-disciplinary approach and the consideration of different aspects of the research pipeline allow us to examine current and future challenges for user-based research. Through an exploration of these issues, this paper also invites others in the VIS-as well as in the wider-research community, to reflect on and discuss the ways in which the current crisis might also present new and previously unexplored opportunities.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a widely used technique for visualization. Nowadays, many of these visualizations are developed for the web, most commonly using JavaScript as the underlying programming language. So far, only few DR methods have a JavaScript implementation though, necessitating developers to write wrappers around implementations in other languages. In addition, those DR methods that exist in JavaScript libraries, such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, do not offer consistent programming interfaces, hampering the quick integration of different methods. Toward a coherent and comprehensive DR programming framework, we developed an open source JavaScript library named DruidJS. Our library contains implementations of ten different DR algorithms, as well as the required linear algebra techniques, tools, and utilities.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this paper, we propose SineStream, a new variant of streamgraphs that improves their readability by minimizing sine illusion effects. Such effects reflect the tendency of humans to take the orthogonal rather than the vertical distance between two curves as their distance. In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that SineStream improves the readability and aesthetics of streamgraphs compared to state-of-the-art methods.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present an integrated approach for creating and assigning color palettes to different visualizations such as multi-class scatterplots, line, and bar charts. While other methods separate the creation of colors from their assignment, our approach takes data characteristics into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art palettes with a controlled user study for scatterplots and line charts, furthermore we performed a case study. Our results show that Palettailor, as a fully-automated approach, generates color palettes with a higher discrimination quality than existing approaches. The efficiency of our optimization allows us also to incorporate user modifications into the color selection process.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We report on an interdisciplinary visual analytics project wherein automotive engineers analyze test drive videos. These videos are annotated with navigation-specific augmented reality (AR) content, and the engineers need to identify issues and evaluate the behavior of the underlying AR navigation system. With the increasing amount of video data, traditional analysis approaches can no longer be conducted in an acceptable timeframe. To address this issue, we collaboratively developed Caarvida, a visual analytics tool that helps engineers to accomplish their tasks faster and handle an increased number of videos. Caarvida combines automatic video analysis with interactive and visual user interfaces. We conducted two case studies which show that Caarvida successfully supports domain experts and speeds up their task completion time.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We propose Compadre, a tool for visual analysis for comparing distances of high-dimensional (HD) data and their low-dimensional projections. At the heart is a matrix visualization to represent the discrepancy between distance matrices, linked side-by-side with 2D scatterplot projections of the data. Using different examples and datasets, we illustrate how this approach fosters (1) evaluating dimensionality reduction techniques w.r.t. how well they project the HD data, (2) comparing them to each other side-by-side, and (3) evaluate important data features through subspace comparison. We also present a case study, in which we analyze IEEE VIS authors from 1990 to 2018, and gain new insights on the relationships between coauthors, citations, and keywords. The coauthors are projected as accurately with UMAP as with t-SNE but the projections show different insights. The structure of the citation subspace is very different from the coauthor subspace. The keyword subspace is noisy yet consistent among the three IEEE VIS sub-conferences.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Simulations of cosmic evolution are a means to explain the formation of the universe as we see it today. The resulting data of such simulations comprise numerous physical quantities, which turns their analysis into a complex task. Here, we analyze such high-dimensional and time-varying particle data using various visualization techniques from the fields of particle visualization, flow visualization, volume visualization, and information visualization. Our approach employs specialized filters to extract and highlight the development of so-called active galactic nuclei and filament structures formed by the particles. Additionally, we calculate X-ray emission of the evolving structures in a preprocessing step to complement visual analysis. Our approach is integrated into a single visual analytics framework to allow for analysis of star formation at interactive frame rates. Finally, we lay out the methodological aspects of our work that led to success at the 2019 IEEE SciVis Contest.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Gaze tracking in 3D has the potential to improve interaction with objects and visualizations in augmented reality. However, previous research showed that subjective perception of distance varies between real and virtual surroundings. We wanted to determine whether objectively measured 3D gaze depth through eye tracking also exhibits differences between entirely real and augmented environments. To this end, we conducted an experiment (N = 25) in which we used Microsoft HoloLens with a binocular eye tracking add-on from Pupil Labs. Participants performed a task that required them to look at stationary real and virtual objects while wearing a HoloLens device. We were not able to find significant differences in the gaze depth measured by eye tracking. Finally, we discuss our findings and their implications for gaze interaction in immersive analytics, and the quality of the collected gaze data. </div>

To support our analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users' interactions, and (iii) collected data of participants' impressions. Our prototype confirms that agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours).

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this paper, we examine the robustness of scagnostics through a series of theoretical and empirical studies. First, we investigate the sensitivity of scagnostics by employing perturbing operations on more than 60M synthetic and real-world scatterplots. We found that two scagnostic measures, Outlying and Clumpy, are overly sensitive to data binning. To understand how these measures align with human judgments of visual features, we conducted a study with 24 participants, which reveals that i) humans are not sensitive to small perturbations of the data that cause large changes in both measures, and ii) the perception of clumpiness heavily depends on per-cluster topologies and structures. Motivated by these results, we propose Robust Scagnostics (RScag) by combining adaptive binning with a hierarchy-based form of scagnostics. An analysis shows that RScag improves on the robustness of original scagnostics, aligns better with human judgments, and is equally fast as the traditional scagnostic measures.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Class separation is an important concept in machine learning and visual analytics. However, the comparison of class separation for datasets with varying dimensionality is non-trivial, given a) the various possible structural characteristics of datasets and b) the plethora of separation measures that exist. Building upon recent findings in visualization research about the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of class separation for 2D dimensionally reduced data using scatterplots, this research addresses the visual analysis of class separation measures for high-dimensional data. We present SepEx, an interactive visualization approach for the assessment and comparison of class separation measures for multiple datasets. SepEx supports analysts with the comparison of multiple separation measures over many high-dimensional datasets, the effect of dimensionality reduction on measure outputs by supporting nD to 2D comparison, and the comparison of the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods on measure outputs. We demonstrate SepEx in a scenario on 100 two-class 5D datasets with a linearly increasing amount of separation between the classes, illustrating both similarities and nonlinearities across 11 measures.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Automatic clustering techniques play a central role in Visual Analytics by helping analysts to discover interesting patterns in high-dimensional data. Evaluating these clustering techniques, however, is difficult due to the lack of universal ground truth. Instead, clustering approaches are usually evaluated based on a subjective visual judgment of low-dimensional scatterplots of different datasets. As clustering is an inherent human-in-the-loop task, we propose a more systematic way of evaluating clustering algorithms based on quantification of human perception of clusters in 2D scatterplots. The core question we are asking is in how far existing clustering techniques align with clusters perceived by humans. To do so, we build on a dataset from a previous study [1], in which 34 human subjects la-beled 1000 synthetic scatterplots in terms of whether they could see one or more than one cluster. Here, we use this dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art clustering techniques in terms of how far they agree with these human judgments. More specifically, we assess 1437 variants of K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, CLIQUE, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering techniques on these benchmarks data. We get unexpected results. For instance, CLIQUE and DBSCAN are at best in slight agreement on this basic cluster counting task, while model-agnostic Agglomerative clustering can be up to a substantial agreement with human subjects depending on the variants. We discuss how to extend this perception-based clustering benchmark approach, and how it could lead to the design of perception-based clustering techniques that would better support more trustworthy and explainable models of cluster patterns.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Knowledge workers, such as scientists, journalists, or consultants, adaptively seek, gather, and consume information. These processes are often inefficient as existing user interfaces provide limited possibilities to combine information from various sources and different formats into a common knowledge representation. In this paper, we present the concept of an information collage (IC) -- a web browser extension combining manual spatial organization of gathered information fragments and automatic text analysis for interactive content exploration and expressive visual summaries. We used IC for case studies with knowledge workers from different domains and longer-term field studies over a period of one month. We identified three different ways how users collect and structure information and provide design recommendations how to support these observed usage strategies. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We propose the concept of Speculative Execution for Visual Analytics and discuss its effectiveness for model exploration and optimization. Speculative Execution enables the automatic generation of alternative, competing model configurations that do not alter the current model state unless explicitly confirmed by the user. These alternatives are computed based on either user interactions or model quality measures and can be explored using delta-visualizations. By automatically proposing modeling alternatives, systems employing Speculative Execution can shorten the gap between users and models, reduce the confirmation bias and speed up optimization processes. In this paper, we have assembled five application scenarios showcasing the potential of Speculative Execution, as well as a potential for further research. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present a framework for rapid prototyping of pervasive visual deficiency simulation in the context of graphical interfaces, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Our framework facilitates the emulation of various visual deficiencies for a wide range of applications, which allows users with normal vision to experience combinations of conditions such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, cataract, nyctalopia, protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia, and achromatopsia. Our framework provides an infrastructure to encourage researchers to evaluate visualization and other display techniques regarding visual deficiencies, and opens up the field of visual disease simulation to a broader audience. The benefits of our framework are easy integration, configuration, fast prototyping, and portability to new emerging hardware. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we showcase a desktop application and an Android application that transform commodity hardware into glasses for visual deficiency simulation. We expect that this work promotes a greater understanding of visual impairments, leads to better product design for the visually impaired, and forms a basis for research to compensate for these impairments as everyday help.</div>

At the core of these approaches are strategies for the selection of candidate instances to label. We introduce degree-of-interest (DOI) functions as atomic building blocks to formalize candidate selection strategies. We introduce a taxonomy of DOI functions and an approach for the visual analysis of DOI functions, which provide novel complementary views on labeling strategies and DOIs, support their in-depth analysis and facilitate their interpretation. Our method shall support the generation of novel and better explanation of existing labeling strategies in future.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present LTMA, a Layered Topic Matching approach for the unsupervised comparative analysis of topic modeling results. Due to the vast number of available modeling algorithms, an efficient and effective comparison of their results is detrimental to a data- and task-driven selection of a model. LTMA automates this comparative analysis by providing topic matching based on two layers (document-overlap and keyword-similarity), creating a novel topic-match data structure. This data structure builds a basis for model exploration and optimization, thus, allowing for an efficient evaluation of their performance in the context of a given type of text data and task. This is especially important for text types where an annotated gold standard dataset is not readily available and, therefore, quantitative evaluation methods are not applicable. We confirm the usefulness of our technique based on three use cases, namely: (1) the automatic comparative evaluation of topic models, (2) the visual exploration of topic modeling differences, and (3) the optimization of topic modeling results through combining matches.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Traditional fisheye views for exploring large graphs introduce substantial distortions that often lead to a decreased readability of paths and other interesting structures. To overcome these problems, we propose a framework for structure-aware fisheye views. Using edge orientations as constraints for graph layout optimization allows us not only to reduce spatial and temporal distortions during fisheye zooms, but also to improve the readability of the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework enables us to optimize fisheye lenses towards specific tasks and design a family of new lenses: polyfocal, cluster, and path lenses. A GPU implementation lets us process large graphs with up to 15,000 nodes at interactive rates. A comprehensive evaluation, a user study, and two case studies demonstrate that our structure-aware fisheye views improve layout readability and user performance.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Appropriate choice of colors significantly aids viewers in understanding the structures in multiclass scatterplots and becomes more important with a growing number of data points and groups. An appropriate color mapping is also an important parameter for the creation of an aesthetically pleasing scatterplot. Currently, users of visualization software routinely rely on color mappings that have been pre-defined by the software. A default color mapping, however, cannot ensure an optimal perceptual separability between groups, and sometimes may even lead to a misinterpretation of the data. In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top K suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our assignment technique, we conducted a numerical study and a controlled user study to compare our approach with default color assignments; our findings were verified by two expert studies. The results show that our approach is able to support users in distinguishing cluster numbers faster and more precisely than default assignment methods.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The labeling of data sets is a time-consuming task, which is, however, an important prerequisite for machine learning and visual analytics. Visual-interactive labeling (VIAL) provides users an active role in the process of labeling, with the goal to combine the potentials of humans and machines to make labeling more efficient. Recent experiments showed that users apply different strategies when selecting instances for labeling with visual-interactive interfaces. In this paper, we contribute a systematic quantitative analysis of such user strategies. We identify computational building blocks of user strategies, formalize them, and investigate their potentials for different machine learning tasks in systematic experiments. The core insights of our experiments are as follows. First, we identified that particular user strategies can be used to considerably mitigate the bootstrap (cold start) problem in early labeling phases. Second, we observed that they have the potential to outperform existing active learning strategies in later phases. Third, we analyzed the identified core building blocks, which can serve as the basis for novel selection strategies. Overall, we observed that data-based user strategies (clusters, dense areas) work considerably well in early phases, while model-based user strategies (e.g., class separation) perform better during later phases.

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">

Visual data analysis is a key tool for helping people to make sense of and interact with massive data sets. However, existing evaluation methods (e.g., database benchmarks, individual user studies) fail to capture the key points that make systems for visual data analysis (or visual data systems) challenging to design. In November 2017, members of both the Database and Visualization communities came together in a Dagstuhl seminar to discuss the grand challenges in the intersection of data analysis and interactive visualization.

In this paper, we report on the discussions of the working group on the evaluation of visual data systems, which addressed questions centered around developing better evaluation methods, such as "How do the different communities evaluate visual data systems?" and "What we could learn from each other to develop evaluation techniques that cut across areas?". In their discussions, the group brainstormed initial steps towards new joint evaluation methods and developed a first concrete initiative --- a trace repository of various real-world workloads and visual data systems --- that enables researchers to derive evaluation setups (e.g., performance benchmarks, user studies) under more realistic assumptions, and enables new evaluation perspectives (e.g., broader meta analysis across analysis contexts, reproducibility and comparability across systems).

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Moving beyond the dominant bag-of-words approach to sentiment analysis we introduce an alternative procedure based on distributed word embeddings. The strength of word embeddings is the ability to capture similarities in word meaning. We use word embeddings as part of a supervised machine learning procedure which estimates levels of negativity in parliamentary speeches. The procedure’s accuracy is evaluated with crowdcoded training sentences; its external validity through a study of patterns of negativity in Austrian parliamentary speeches. The results show the potential of the word embeddings approach for sentiment analysis in the social sciences.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The assignment of labels to data instances is a fundamental prerequisite for many machine learning tasks. Moreover, labeling is a frequently applied process in visual interactive analysis approaches and visual analytics. However, the strategies for creating labels usually differ between these two fields. This raises the question whether synergies between the different approaches can be attained. In this paper, we study the process of labeling data instances with the user in the loop, from both the machine learning and visual interactive perspective. Based on a review of differences and commonalities, we propose the “visual interactive labeling” (VIAL) process that unifies both approaches. We describe the six major steps of the process and discuss their specific challenges. Additionally, we present two heterogeneous usage scenarios from the novel VIAL perspective, one on metric distance learning and one on object detection in videos. Finally, we discuss general challenges to VIAL and point out necessary work for the realization of future VIAL approaches.</div>

We propose a conceptual framework that models human interactions with ML components in the VA process, and that puts the central relationship between automated algorithms and interactive visualizations into sharp focus. The framework is illustrated with several examples and we further elaborate on the interactive ML process by identifying key scenarios where ML methods are combined with human feedback through interactive visualization. We derive five open research challenges at the intersection of ML and visualization research, whose solution should lead to more effective data analysis.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this position paper, we propose and discuss a lightweight framework to help organize research questions that arise around biases in visualization and visual analysis. We contrast our framework against cognitive bias codex by Buster Benson. The framework is inspired by Norman’s Human Action Cycle [23] and classifies biases into three levels: perceptual biases, action biases, and social biases. For each of the levels of cognitive processing, we discuss examples of biases from the cognitive science literature, and speculate how they might also be important to the area of visualization. In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist. We hope that the framework will help spark new ideas and discussions on how to proceed studying the important topic of biases in visualization.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We investigate priming and anchoring effects on perceptual tasks in visualization. Priming or anchoring effects depict the phenomena that a stimulus might influence subsequent human judgments on a perceptual level, or on a cognitive level by providing a frame of reference. Using visual class separability in scatterplots as an example task, we performed a set of five studies to investigate the potential existence of priming and anchoring effects. Our findings show that - under certain circumstances - such effects indeed exist. In other words, humans judge class separability of the same scatterplot differently depending on the scatterplot(s) they have seen before. These findings inform future work on better understanding and more accurately modeling human perception of visual patterns.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Labeling data instances is an important task in machine learning and visual analytics. Both fields provide a broad set of labeling strategies, whereby machine learning (and in particular active learning) follows a rather model-centered approach and visual analytics employs rather user-centered approaches (visual-interactive labeling). Both approaches have individual strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we conduct an experiment with three parts to assess and compare the performance of these different labeling strategies. In our study, we (1) identify different visual labeling strategies for user-centered labeling, (2) investigate strengths and weaknesses of labeling strategies for different labeling tasks and task complexities, and (3) shed light on the effect of using different visual encodings to guide the visual-interactive labeling process. We further compare labeling of single versus multiple instances at a time, and quantify the impact on efficiency. We systematically compare the performance of visual interactive labeling with that of active learning. Our main findings are that visual-interactive labeling can outperform active learning, given the condition that dimension reduction separates well the class distributions. Moreover, using dimension reduction in combination with additional visual encodings that expose the internal state of the learning model turns out to improve the performance of visual-interactive labeling.</div>

At its heart, EdWordle allows users to move and edit words while preserving the neighborhoods of other words. To do so, we combine a constrained rigid body simulation with a neighborhood-aware local Wordle algorithm to update the cloud and to create very compact layouts. The consistent and stable behavior of EdWordle enables users to create new forms of word clouds such as storytelling clouds in which the position of words is carefully edited. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods and show that we can improve user performance, user satisfaction, as well as the layout itself.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present an improved stress majorization method that incorporates various constraints, including directional constraints without the necessity of solving a constraint optimization problem. This is achieved by reformulating the stress function to impose constraints on both the edge vectors and lengths instead of just on the edge lengths (node distances). This is a unified framework for both constrained and unconstrained graph visualizations, where we can model most existing layout constraints, as well as develop new ones such as the star shapes and cluster separation constraints within stress majorization. This improvement also allows us to parallelize computation with an efficient GPU conjugant gradient solver, which yields fast and stable solutions, even for large graphs. As a result, we allow the constraint-based exploration of large graphs with 10K nodes - an approach which previous methods cannot support.</div>

We compare 1D slices to 2D slices and topological views, first, by looking at their performance with respect to common function analysis tasks. We also demonstrate 3 usage scenarios: the 2D sinc function, neural network regression, and optimization traces. Based on this evaluation, we characterize the advantages and drawbacks of each of these approaches, and show how interaction can be used to overcome some of the shortcomings.},

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this paper, we use several supervised machine learning approaches and compare their success in predicting the sentiment of Austrian parliamentary speeches and news reports (German language). Prediction results in learning- based sentiment analysis vary strongly. They depend on the choice of algorithm and its parameterization, the quality and quantity of available training data as well as the selection of appropriate input feature representations. Our training data contains human-annotated sentiment scores at the phrase and sentence level. Going beyond the dominant bag-of-words modeling approach in traditional natural language processing, we also test sentiment analysis for neural network-based distributed representations of words. The latter reflect syntactic as well as semantic relatedness, but require huge amounts of training examples. We test both approaches with heterogeneous textual data, compare their success rates and provide conclusions on how to improve the sentiment analysis of political communication.

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a common strategy for visual analysis of labeled high-dimensional data. Low-dimensional representations of the data help, for instance, to explore the class separability and the spatial distribution of the data. Widely-used unsupervised DR methods like PCA do not aim to maximize the class separation, while supervised DR methods like LDA often assume certain spatial distributions and do not take perceptual capabilities of humans into account. These issues make them ineffective for complicated class structures. Towards filling this gap, we present a perception-driven linear dimensionality reduction approach that maximizes the perceived class separation in projections. Our approach builds on recent developments in perception-based separation measures that have achieved good results in imitating human perception. We extend these measures to be density-aware and incorporate them into a customized simulated annealing algorithm, which can rapidly generate a near optimal DR projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to state-of-the-art DR methods on 93 datasets, using both quantitative measure and human judgments. We also provide case studies with class-imbalanced and unlabeled data.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Incivility of political communication has become a major topic in public and scientific discourse (e.g. Herbst 2010; Berry and Sobieraj 2013), and it is often seen as a cause of increasing political polarization, lower electoral turnout and voter disaffection with politics and democracy in general (Jamieson 1992; Kahn and Kenny 1999; Mutz and Reeves 2005, Mutz 2007; Brooks and Geer 2007; Lau and Rovner 2009; Harcourt 2012). However, there is no agreement on the definition or measurement of incivility. Our paper presents an automated sentiment analysis to identify uncivil language and to measure the level of (in)civility in parliamentary speeches. Substantively, we study incivility in the Austrian national parliament during the last two decades (1996-2013) and explore some of the political, institutional and individual factors that affect the level of incivility shown in parliamentary debates. We check whether government/opposition status, the parliamentary role, the type of debate and closeness to the next election has an effect on the level of civility observed in parliament.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present a case study on how a team of instructors put learner-centered principles into practice in a large undergraduate course on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that was run in 4 parallel groups of about 50 students. The course stands on the crossroads between software engineering, business, and research in so far as student-teams apply human-centered design techniques to develop mobile apps, test them with real end-users, read research papers and regularly reflect upon their experience. As a proof of the course-concept, selected results from formative and summative assessments are presented. The summative results show that students rated the course as one of the best of the 87 computer science courses run in the summer term of 2015 at the University of Vienna. The primary goal of this paper is to provide instructors intrigued by learner-centered approaches with ideas for their own practice. In particular, this paper is of interest to those who teach Human-Computer Interaction and to those who seek inspiration on mapping their course to the 14 learner-centered principles.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present the results of a comprehensive multi-pass analysis of visualization paper keywords supplied by authors for their papers published in the IEEE Visualization conference series (now called IEEE VIS) between 1990-2015. From this analysis we derived a set of visualization topics that we discuss in the context of the current taxonomy that is used to categorize papers and assign reviewers in the IEEE VIS reviewing process. We point out missing and overemphasized topics in the current taxonomy and start a discussion on the importance of establishing common visualization terminology. Our analysis of research topics in visualization can, thus, serve as a starting point to (a) help create a common vocabulary to improve communication among different visualization sub-groups, (b) facilitate the process of understanding differences and commonalities of the various research sub-fields in visualization, (c) provide an understanding of emerging new research trends, (d) facilitate the crucial step of finding the right reviewers for research submissions, and (e) it can eventually lead to a comprehensive taxonomy of visualization research. One additional tangible outcome of our work is an online query tool (http://keyvis.org/) that allows visualization researchers to easily browse the 3952 keywords used for IEEE VIS papers since 1990 to find related work or make informed keyword choices.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a core building block in visualizing multidimensional data. For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Our goal is to accurately model human class separation judgements in color-coded scatterplots. Towards this goal, we propose a set of 2002 visual separation measures, by systematically combining 17 neighborhood graphs and 14 class purity functions, with different parameterizations. Using a Machine Learning framework, we evaluate these measures based on how well they predict human separation judgements. We found that more than 58% of the 2002 new measures outperform the best state-of-the-art Distance Consistency (DSC) measure. Among the 2002, the best measure is the average proportion of same-class neighbors among the 0.35-Observable Neighbors of each point of the target class (short GONG 0.35 DIR CPT), with a prediction accuracy of 92.9%, which is 11.7% better than DSC. We also discuss alternative, well-performing measures and give guidelines when to use which.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Medical doctors and researchers in bio-medicine are increasingly confronted with complex patient data, posing new and difficult analysis challenges. These data are often comprising high-dimensional descriptions of patient conditions and measurements on the success of certain therapies. An important analysis question in such data is to compare and correlate patient conditions and therapy results along with combinations of dimensions. As the number of dimensions is often very large, one needs to map them to a smaller number of relevant dimensions to be more amenable for expert analysis. This is because irrelevant, redundant, and conflicting dimensions can negatively affect effectiveness and efficiency of the analytic process (the so-called curse of dimensionality). However, the possible mappings from high- to low-dimensional spaces are ambiguous. For example, the similarity between patients may change by considering different combinations of relevant dimensions (subspaces). We demonstrate the potential of subspace analysis for the interpretation of high-dimensional medical data. Specifically, we present SubVIS, an interactive tool to visually explore subspace clusters from different perspectives, introduce a novel analysis workflow, and discuss future directions for high-dimensional (medical) data analysis and its visual exploration. We apply the presented workflow to a real-world dataset from the medical domain and show its usefulness with a domain expert evaluation.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Today, journalists increasingly deal with complex, large, and heterogeneous datasets and, thus, face challenges in integration, wrangling, analysis, and reporting these data. Besides, the lack of money, time, and skills influence their journalistic work. Information visualization and visual analytics offer possibilities to support data journalists. This paper contributes to an overview of a possible characterization and abstraction of certain aspects of data-driven journalism in Austria. A case study was conducted based on the dataset of media transparency in Austria. We conducted four semi- structured interviews with Austrian data journalists, as well as an exploratory data analysis of the media transparency dataset. To categorize our findings we used Munzner ́s analytical framework and the Data-User-Task Design Triangle by Miksch and Aigner.

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">An increasing number of interactive visualization tools stress the integration with computational software like MATLAB and R to access a variety of proven algorithms. In many cases, however, the algorithms are used as black boxes that run to completion in isolation which contradicts the needs of interactive data exploration. This paper structures, formalizes, and discusses possibilities to enable user involvement in ongoing computations. Based on a structured characterization of needs regarding intermediate feedback and control, the main contribution is a formalization and comparison of strategies for achieving user involvement for algorithms with different characteristics. In the context of integration, we describe considerations for implementing these strategies either as part of the visualization tool or as part of the algorithm, and we identify requirements and guidelines for the design of algorithmic APIs. To assess the practical applicability, we provide a survey of frequently used algorithm implementations within R regarding the fulfillment of these guidelines. While echoing previous calls for analysis modules which support data exploration more directly, we conclude that a range of pragmatic options for enabling user involvement in ongoing computations exists on both the visualization and algorithm side and should be used.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Various case studies in different application domains have shown the great potential of visual parameter space analysis to support validating and using simulation models. In order to guide and systematize research endeavors in this area, we provide a conceptual framework for visual parameter space analysis problems. The framework is based on our own experience and a structured analysis of the visualization literature. It contains three major components: (1) a data flow model that helps to abstractly describe visual parameter space analysis problems independent of their application domain; (2) a set of four navigation strategies of how parameter space analysis can be supported by visualization tools; and (3) a characterization of six analysis tasks. Based on our framework, we analyze and classify the current body of literature, and identify three open research gaps in visual parameter space analysis. The framework and its discussion are meant to support visualization designers and researchers in characterizing parameter space analysis problems and to guide their design and evaluation processes.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present the results of a comprehensive analysis of visualization paper keywords supplied for 4366 papers submitted to five main visualization conferences. We describe main keywords, topic areas, and 10-year historic trends from two datasets: (1) the standardized PCS taxonomy keywords in use for paper submissions for IEEE InfoVis, IEEE Vis-SciVis, IEEE VAST, EuroVis, and IEEE PacificVis since 2009 and (2) the author-chosen keywords for papers published in the IEEE Visualization conference series (now called IEEE VIS) since 2004. Our analysis of research topics in visualization can serve as a starting point to (a) help create a common vocabulary to improve communication among different visualization sub-groups, (b) facilitate the process of understanding differences and commonalities of the various research sub-fields in visualization, (c) provide an understanding of emerging new research trends, (d) facilitate the crucial step of finding the right reviewers for research submissions, and (e) it can eventually lead to a comprehensive taxonomy of visualization research. One additional tangible outcome of our work is an application that allows visualization researchers to easily browse the 2600+ keywords used for IEEE VIS papers during the past 10 years, aiming at more informed and, hence, more effective keyword selections for future visualization publications. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We propose the nested blocks and guidelines model for the design and validation of visualization systems. The nested blocks and guidelines model extends the previously proposed four-level nested model by adding finer grained structure within each level, providing explicit mechanisms to capture and discuss design decision rationale. Blocks are the outcomes of the design process at a specific level, and guidelines discuss relationships between these blocks. Blocks at the algorithm and technique levels describe design choices, as do data blocks at the abstraction level, whereas task abstraction blocks and domain situation blocks are identified as the outcome of the designer’s understanding of the requirements. In the nested blocks and guidelines model, there are two types of guidelines: within-level guidelines provide comparisons for blocks within the same level, while between-level guidelines provide mappings between adjacent levels of design. We analyze several recent articles using the nested blocks and guidelines model to provide concrete examples of how a researcher can use blocks and guidelines to describe and evaluate visualization research. We also discuss the nested blocks and guidelines model with respect to other design models to clarify its role in visualization design. Using the nested blocks and guidelines model, we pinpoint two implications for visualization evaluation. First, comparison of blocks at the domain level must occur implicitly downstream at the abstraction level; second, comparison between blocks must take into account both upstream assumptions and downstream requirements. Finally, we use the model to analyze two open problems: the need for mid-level task taxonomies to fill in the task blocks at the abstraction level and the need for more guidelines mapping between the algorithm and technique levels.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">To verify cluster separation in high-dimensional data, analysts often reduce the data with a dimension reduction (DR) technique, and then visualize it with 2D Scatterplots, interactive 3D Scatterplots, or Scatterplot Matrices (SPLOMs). With the goal of providing guidance between these visual encoding choices, we conducted an empirical data study in which two human coders manually inspected a broad set of 816 scatterplots derived from 75 datasets, 4 DR techniques, and the 3 previously mentioned scatterplot techniques. Each coder scored all color-coded classes in each scatterplot in terms of their separability from other classes. We analyze the resulting quantitative data with a heatmap approach, and qualitatively discuss interesting scatterplot examples. Our findings reveal that 2D scatterplots are often 'good enough', that is, neither SPLOM nor interactive 3D adds notably more cluster separability with the chosen DR technique. If 2D is not good enough, the most promising approach is to use an alternative DR technique in 2D. Beyond that, SPLOM occasionally adds additional value, and interactive 3D rarely helps but often hurts in terms of poorer class separation and usability. We summarize these results as a workflow model and implications for design. Our results offer guidance to analysts during the DR exploration process.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We present an assessment of the state and historic development of evaluation practices as reported in papers published at the IEEE Visualization conference. Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this paper, we introduce ParaGlide, a visualization system designed for interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multidimensional simulation models. To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to go back and forth between setting input parameters and qualitatively judging the outcomes of their model. Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions about parameter configurations a tedious and workload-intensive task. ParaGlide endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by guiding data generation using a region-based user interface for parameter sampling and then dividing the model's input parameter space into partitions that represent distinct output behavior. In particular, we found that parameter space partitioning can help model developers to better understand qualitative differences among possibly high-dimensional model outputs. Further, it provides information on parameter sensitivity and facilitates comparison of models. We developed ParaGlide in close collaboration with experts from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and derived a set of tasks and design requirements, then engaged in a user-centered design process, and finally conducted three longitudinal in-depth case studies underlining the usefulness of our approach.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Design studies are an increasingly popular form of problem-driven visualization research, yet there is little guidance available about how to do them effectively. In this paper we reflect on our combined experience of conducting twenty-one design studies, as well as reading and reviewing many more, and on an extensive literature review of other field work methods and methodologies. Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.</div>

The task and data abstractions that we derived support actively making changes to an overlay network, where logical communication specifications must be mapped to an underlying physical network. These abstractions are very different from the dominant use case in visual network analysis, namely identifying clusters and central nodes, that stems from the domain of social network analysis. Our visualization tool RelEx was created and iteratively refined through a full user-centered design process that included a full problem characterization phase before tool design began, paper prototyping, iterative refinement in close collaboration with expert users for formative evaluation, deployment in the field with real analysts using their own data, usability testing with non-expert users, and summative evaluation at the end of the deployment. In the summative post-deployment study, which entailed domain experts using the tool over several weeks in their daily practice, we documented many examples where the use of RelEx simplified or sped up their work compared to previous practices.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Despite an abundance of technical literature on dimension reduction (DR), our understanding of how real data analysts are using DR techniques and what problems they face remains largely incomplete. In this paper, we contribute the first systematic and broad analysis of DR usage by a sample of real data analysts, along with their needs and problems. We present the results of a two-year qualitative research endeavor, in which we iteratively collected and analyzed a rich corpus of data in the spirit of grounded theory. We interviewed 24 data analysts from different domains and surveyed papers depicting applications of DR. The result is a descriptive taxonomy of DR usage, and concrete real-world usage examples summarized in terms of this taxonomy. We also identify seven gaps where user DR needs are unfulfilled by currently available techniques, and three mismatches where the users do not need offered techniques. At the heart of our taxonomy is a task classification that differentiates between abstract tasks related to point clusters and those related to dimensions. The taxonomy and usage examples are intended to provide a better descriptive understanding of real data analysts practices and needs with regards to DR. The gaps are intended as prescriptive pointers to future research directions, with the most important gaps being a lack of support for users without expertise in the mathematics of DR, and an absence of DR techniques for comparing explicit groups of dimensions or for relating non-linear embeddings to original dimensions.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We provide two contributions, a taxonomy of visual cluster separation factors in scatterplots, and an in-depth qualitative evaluation of two recently proposed and validated separation measures. We initially intended to use these measures to provide guidance for the use of dimension reduction (DR) techniques and visual encoding (VE) choices, but found that they failed to produce reliable results. To understand why, we conducted a systematic qualitative data study covering a broad collection of 75 real and synthetic high-dimensional datasets, four DR techniques, and three scatterplot-based visual encodings. Two authors visually inspected over 800 plots to determine whether or not the measures created plausible results. We found that they failed in over half the cases overall, and in over two-thirds of the cases involving real datasets. Using open and axial coding of failure reasons and separability characteristics, we generated a taxonomy of visual cluster separability factors. We iteratively refined its explanatory clarity and power by mapping the studied datasets and success and failure ranges of the measures onto the factor axes. Our taxonomy has four categories, ordered by their ability to influence successors: Scale, Point Distance, Shape, and Position.

abstract = {Abstract We provide two contributions, a taxonomy of visual cluster separation factors in scatterplots, and an in-depth qualitative evaluation of two recently proposed and validated separation measures. We initially intended to use these measures to provide guidance for the use of dimension reduction (DR) techniques and visual encoding (VE) choices, but found that they failed to produce reliable results. To understand why, we conducted a systematic qualitative data study covering a broad collection of 75 real and synthetic high-dimensional datasets, four DR techniques, and three scatterplot-based visual encodings. Two authors visually inspected over 800 plots to determine whether or not the measures created plausible results. We found that they failed in over half the cases overall, and in over two-thirds of the cases involving real datasets. Using open and axial coding of failure reasons and separability characteristics, we generated a taxonomy of visual cluster separability factors. We iteratively refined its explanatory clarity and power by mapping the studied datasets and success and failure ranges of the measures onto the factor axes. Our taxonomy has four categories, ordered by their ability to influence successors: Scale, Point Distance, Shape, and Position. Each category is split into Within-Cluster factors such as density, curvature, isotropy, and clumpiness, and Between-Cluster factors that arise from the variance of these properties, culminating in the overarching factor of class separation. The resulting taxonomy can be used to guide the design and the evaluation of cluster separation measures.},

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">In this paper we introduce paraglide, a visualization system designed for interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multi-variate simulation models. To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to go back and forth between setting parameters and qualitatively judging the outcomes of their model. During this process, they build up a grounded understanding of the parameter effects in order to pick the right setting. Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions about parameter settings a tedious and workload-intensive task. Paraglide endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by assisting the sampling of the parameter space and the discovery of qualitatively different model outcomes. This results in a decomposition of the model parameter space into regions of distinct behaviour. We developed paraglide in close collaboration with experts from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and derived a set of design requirements, then engaged in a longitudinal user-centered design process, and finally conducted three in-depth case studies underlining the usefulness of our approach. </div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We examine the implications of evaluating data analysis processes and information visualization tools in a large company setting. While several researchers have addressed the difficulties of evaluating information visualizations with regards to changing data, tasks, and visual encodings, considerably less work has been published on the difficulties of evaluation within specific work contexts. We specifically focus on the challenges, which arise in the context of large companies with several thousand employees. Based on our own experience from a 3.5-year collaboration within a large automotive company, we first present a collection of nine information visualization evaluation challenges. We then discuss these challenges by means of two concrete visualization case studies from our own work. We finally derive a set of 16 recommendations for planning and conducting evaluations in large company settings. The set of challenges and recommendations and the discussion of our experience are meant to provide practical guidance to other researchers and practitioners, who plan to study information visualization in large company settings.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The choices we take when listening to music are expressions of our personal taste and character. Storing and accessing our listening histories is trivial due to services like Last.fm, but learning from them and understanding them is not. Existing solutions operate at a very abstract level and only produce statistics. By applying techniques from information visualization to this problem, we were able to provide average people with a detailed and powerful tool for accessing their own musical past. LastHistory is an interactive visualization for displaying music listening histories, along with contextual information from personal photos and calendar entries. Its two main user tasks are (1) analysis, with an emphasis on temporal patterns and hypotheses related to musical genre and sequences, and (2) reminiscing, where listening histories and context represent part of one's past. In this design study paper we give an overview of the field of music listening histories and explain their unique characteristics as a type of personal data. We then describe the design rationale, data and view transformations of LastHistory and present the results from both a laband a large-scale online study. We also put listening histories in contrast to other lifelogging data. The resonant and enthusiastic feedback that we received from average users shows a need for making their personal data accessible. We hope to stimulate such developments through this research.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Analyzing, understanding and working with complex systems and large datasets has become a familiar challenge in the information era. The explosion of data worldwide affects nearly every part of society, particularly the science, engineering, health, and financial domains. Looking, for instance at the automotive industry, engineers are confronted with the enormously increased complexity of vehicle electronics. Over the years, a large number of advanced functions, such as ACC (adaptive cruise control), rear seat entertainment systems or automatic start/stop engines, has been integrated into the vehicle. Thereby, the functions have been more and more distributed over the vehicle, leading to the introduction of several communication networks. Overlooking all relevant data facets, understanding dependencies, analyzing the flow of messages and tracking down problems in these networks has become a major challenge for automotive engineers.  

Promising approaches to overcome information overload and to provide insight into complex data are Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Visual Analytics (VA). Over the last decades, these research communities spent much effort on developing new methods to help users obtain insight into complex data. However, few of these solutions have yet reached end users, and moving research into practice remains one of the great challenges in visual data analysis. This situation is particularly true for large company settings, where very little is known about additional challenges, obstacles and requirements in InfoVis/VA development and evaluation. Users have to be better integrated into our research processes in terms of adequate requirements analysis, understanding practices and challenges, developing well-directed, user-centered technologies and evaluating their value within a realistic context.  

This dissertation explores a novel InfoVis/VA application area, namely in-car communication networks, and demonstrates how information visualization methods and techniques can help engineers to work with and better understand these networks. Based on a three-year internship with a large automotive company and the close cooperation with domain experts, I grounded a profound understanding of specific challenges, requirements and obstacles for InfoVis/VA application in this area and learned that “designing with not for the people” is highly important for successful solutions. The three main contributions of this dissertation are: (1) An empirical analysis of current working practices of automotive engineers and the derivation of specific design requirements for InfoVis/VA tools; (2) the successful application and evaluation of nine prototypes, including the deployment of five systems; and (3) based on the three-year experience, a set of recommendations for developing and evaluating InfoVis systems in large company settings.

I present ethnographic studies with more than 150 automotive engineers. These studies helped us to understand currently used tools, the underlying data, tasks as well as user groups and to categorize the field into application sub-domains. Based on these findings, we propose implications and recommendations for designing tools to support current practices of automotive network engineers with InfoVis/VA technologies. I also present nine InfoVis design studies that we built and evaluated with automotive domain experts and use them to systematically explore the design space of applying InfoVis to in-car communication networks. Each prototype was developed in a user-centered, participatory process, respectively with a focus on a specific sub-domain of target users with specific data and tasks. Experimental results from studies with real users are presented, that show that the visualization prototypes can improve the engineers’ work in terms of working efficiency, better understanding and novel insights. Based on lessons learned from repeatedly designing and evaluating our tools together with domain experts at a large automotive company, I discuss challenges and present recommendations for deploying and evaluating VA/InfoVis tools in large company settings. I hope that these recommendations can guide other InfoVis researchers and practitioners in similar projects by providing them with new insights, such as the necessity for close integration with current tools and given processes, distributed knowledge and high degree of specialization, and the importance of addressing prevailing mental models and time restrictions. In general, I think that large company settings are a promising and fruitful field for novel InfoVis applications and expect our recommendations to be useful tools for other researchers and tool designers.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">We examine the process and some implications of evaluating information visualization in a large company setting. While several researchers have addressed the difficulties of evaluating information visualizations with regards to changing data, tasks, and visual encodings, considerably less work has been published on the difficulties of evaluation within specific work contexts. In this paper, we specifically focus on the challenges arising in the context of large companies with several thousand employees. We present a collection of evaluation challenges, discuss our own experiences conducting information visualization evaluation within the context of a large automotive company, and present a set of recommendations derived from our experiences.

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The MOST bus is a current bus technology for connecting multimedia components in cars, such as radios, navigation systems, or media players. The bus functionality is described in a large hierarchically structured catalog of some 4psila000 entries. Browsing this catalog has become infeasible on paper as well as with currently used textual database interfaces. An observation of current work practices has revealed many problems and inefficiencies. We describe the (iteratively developed) design of MostVis, a visual tool for exploring MOST function catalogs, as well as an evaluation of our implemented prototype. Our design carefully adapts existing visualization techniques and combines them in a multiple coordinated view (MCV) approach to satisfy the specific needs of our target group. With this paper, we hope to provide a living example of how existing general-purpose techniques can be successfully trimmed and tailored for a very specific audience.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">The Old Library of Trinity College Dublin, built in 1732, is an internationally renowned research library. In recent decades it has also become a major tourist attraction in Dublin, with the display of the Book of Kells within the Old Library now drawing over half a million visitors per year. The Preservation and Conservation Department of the Library has raised concerns about the impact of the environment on the collection. The location of the building in the city centre, large visitor numbers, and the conditions within the building are putting the collection at risk. In developing a strategic plan to find solutions to these problems, the department has been assessing and documenting the current situation. This paper introduces ongoing work on a system to visualise the collected data, which includes: dust levels and dispersion, internal and external temperature and relative humidity levels, and visitor numbers in the Old Library. We are developing a user interface for which the data, originally stored in various file formats, is consolidated in a database which can be explored using a 3D virtual reconstruction of the Old Library. With this novel technique, it is also possible to compare and assess the relationships between the various datasets in context.</div>

However, a variety of abstract datasets can indeed be related to, and hence enriched by, real-world aspects.

We demonstrate this approach with two prototype systems that combine information visualisation with 3D models in multiple coordinated views. The first prototype involves the visualisation of in-car communication traces. The 3D model of the car serves as one view among several and provides the user with information about the car’s activities. LibViz, our second prototype, is based on a full screen 3D representation of a library building. Measured data is visualised in overlaid, semi-transparent windows to allow the user interpretation of the data in its spatial context of the library’s 3D model. Based on the two prototypes, we identify the benefits and drawbacks of the approach, investigate aspects of coordination between the 3D model and the abstract visualisations, and discuss principals for a general approach.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">With the increasing complexity of in-car communication architectures, their diagnostics have become essential for automotive development and maintenance. In order to help engineers to detect and analyze the potential sources and consequences of errors, it is crucial to provide both comprehensive and detailed insight into the communication processes and their contexts. Two important aspects of these are the dependencies and correlations between onboard functions. In this paper we present a dual-view visualization for exploring the functional dependency chains of in-car communication processes. One view presents the dependencies of hardware components using a space filling approach similar to a treemap, whereas the other view displays the functional correlations as an interactive sequence chart. The views are coupled via color coding and show the dependencies of an interactively selectable functional unit. In an expert evaluation, we assessed the benefits of using this visualization technique for in-car communication diagnostics with very positive results.</div>

      <h4>Abstract</h4><div class="abstract">Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a standardized and widespread form to visually describe interactions in distributed systems. Our approach proposes the enrichment of large scaled MSCs with novel interaction and design techniques used in the field of information visualization. Additionally, we show a graphical solution to visualize parallel, multi-directed communication processes in MSCs. Instead of the common application to specify system behaviours our interactive MSCs are aimed at exploring and diagnosing dependencies in network communication in general and, regarding our special requirements, within in-car communication traces. We implemented a prototype called MSCar with Focus and Context techniques, Dynamic Path Highlighting, Details on Demand and Colour Coding to support the users' cognitive abilities. A qualitative user study on MSCar gave us
preliminary feedback and disclosed potentials of our approach.</div>
