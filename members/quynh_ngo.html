            <div class="abstract">
                The development of new pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) has steadily increased over the years. Commonly, PRNGs’ randomness is “measured” by using statistical pass/fail suite tests, but the question remains, which PRNG is the best when compared to others. Existing randomness tests lack means for comparisons between PRNGs, since they are not quantitatively analysing. It is, therefore, an important task to analyze the quality of randomness for each PRNG, or, in general, comparing the randomness property among PRNGs. In this paper, we propose a novel visual approach to analyze PRNGs randomness allowing for a ranking comparison concerning the PRNGs’ quality. Our analysis approach is applied to ensembles of time series which are outcomes of different PRNG runs. The ensembles are generated by using a single PRNG method with different parameter settings or by using different PRNG methods. We propose a similarity metric for PRNG time series for randomness and apply it within an interactive visual approach for analyzing similarities of PRNG time series and relating them to an optimal result of perfect randomness. The interactive analysis leads to an unsupervised classification, from which respective conclusions about the impact of the PRNGs’ parameters or rankings of PRNGs on randomness are derived. We report new findings using our approach in a study of randomness for state-of-the-art numerical PRNGs such as LCG, PCG, SplitMix, Mersenne Twister, and RANDU as well as chaos-based PRNG families such as K-Logistic map and K-Tent map with varying parameter K.

            <div class="abstract">
                Visual analysis of multi-dimensional data is commonly supported by mapping the data to a 2D embedding. When analyzing a sequence of multi-dimensional data, e.g., in case of temporal data, the usage of 1D embeddings allows for plotting the entire sequence in a 2D layout. Despite the good performance in generating 2D embeddings, 1D embeddings often exhibit a much lower quality for pattern recognition tasks. We propose to overcome the issue by involving the user to generate 1D embeddings of multi-dimensional data in a two-step procedure: We first generate a 2D embedding and then leave the task of reducing the 2D to a 1D embedding to the user. We demonstrate that an interactive generation of 1D embeddings from 2D projected views can be performed efficiently, effectively, and targeted towards an analysis task. We compare the performance of our approach against automatically generated 1D and 2D embeddings involving a user study for our interactive approach. We test the 1D approaches when being applied to time-varying multi-dimensional data.

                Mathematical billiards assume a table of a certain shape and dynamical rules for handling collisions. Some trajectories exhibit distinguished patterns. Detecting such trajectories manually for a given billiard is cumbersome, especially, when assuming an ensemble of billiards with different parameter settings. We propose a visual analysis approach for simulation ensembles of billiard dynamics based on phase-space visualizations and multi-dimensional scaling. We apply our methods to the well-studied approach of dynamical billiards for validation and to the novel approach of symplectic billiards for new observations.

            <div class="abstract">
                A central question in the field of Network Science is to analyze the role of a given network topology on the dynamical behavior captured by time-varying simulations executed on the network. These dynamical systems are also influenced by global simulation parameters. We present a visual analytics approach that supports the investigation of the impact of the parameter settings, i.e., how parameter choices change the role of network topology on the simulations' dynamics. To answer this question, we are analyzing ensembles of simulation runs with different parameter settings executed on a given network topology. We relate the nodes' topological structures to their dynamical similarity in a 2D plot based on an interactively defined hierarchy of topological properties and a 1D embedding for the dynamical similarity. We evaluate interactively defined topological groups with respect to matching dynamical behavior, which we visually encode as graphs of the function of the considered simulation parameter. Interactive filtering and coordinated views allow for a detailed analysis of the parameter space with respect to topology-dynamics relations. Our visual analytics approach is applied to scenarios for excitable dynamics on synthetic and real brain connectome networks.

                A good deep neural network design allows for efficient training and high accuracy. The training step requires a suitable choice of several hyper-parameters. Limited knowledge exists on how the hyper-parameters impact the training process, what is the interplay of multiple hyper-parameters, and what is the interrelation of hyper-parameters and network topology. In this paper, we present a structured analysis towards these goals by investigating an ensemble of training runs.We propose a visual ensemble analysis based on hyper-parameter space visualizations, performance visualizations, and visualizing correlations of topological structures. As a proof of concept, we apply our approach to deep convolutional neural networks.

                The role of network topology on the dynamics in simulations that are executed on the network is a central question in the field of network science. However, the influence of the topology is affected by the global dynamical simulation parameters. To investigate this impact of the parameter settings, multiple simulation runs are executed with different settings. Moreover, since the outcome of a single simulation run also depends on the randomly chosen start configurations, multiple runs with the same settings are carried out, as well. We present a visual approach to analyze the role of topology in such an ensemble of simulation ensembles. We use the dynamics of an excitable network implemented in the form of a coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) following the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and modular network topologies.

                To understand how topology shapes the dynamics in excitable networks is one of the fundamental problems in network science when applied to computational systems biology and neuroscience. Recent advances in the field discovered the influential role of two macroscopic topological structures, namely hubs and modules. We propose a visual analytics approach that allows for a systematic exploration of the role of those macroscopic topological structures on the dynamics in excitable networks. Dynamical patterns are discovered using the dynamical features of excitation ratio and co-activation. Our approach is based on the interactive analysis of the correlation of topological and dynamical features using coordinated views. We designed suitable visual encodings for both the topological and the dynamical features. A degree map and an adjacency matrix visualization allow for the interaction with hubs and modules, respectively. A barycentric-coordinates layout and a multi-dimensional scaling approach allow for the analysis of excitation ratio and co-activation, respectively. We demonstrate how the interplay of the visual encodings allows us to quickly reconstruct recent findings in the field within an interactive analysis and even discovered new patterns. We apply our approach to network models of commonly investigated topologies as well as to the structural networks representing the connectomes of different species. We evaluate our approach with domain experts in terms of its intuitiveness, expressiveness, and usefulness.
