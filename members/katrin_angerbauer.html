            <div class="abstract">
                Collaboration is essential in companies and often physical presence is required, thus, more and more Virtual Reality (VR) systems are used to work together remotely. To support social interaction, human representations in form of avatars are used in collaborative virtual environment (CVE) tools. However, up to now, the avatar representations often are limited in their design and functionality, which may hinder effective collaboration. In our interview study, we explored the status quo of VR collaboration in a large automotive company setting with a special focus on the role of avatars. We collected inter-view data from 21 participants, from which we identified challenges of current avatar representations used in our setting. Based on these findings, we discuss design suggestions for avatars in a company setting, which aim to improve social interaction. As opposed to state-of-the-art research, we found that users within the context of a large automotive company have an altered need with respect to avatar representations.

                The world is still under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though vaccines are deployed as rapidly as possible, it is still necessary to use other measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Measures such as social distancing or wearing a mask receive a lot of criticism. Therefore, we want to demonstrate a serious game to help the players understand these measures better and show them why they are still necessary. The player of the game has to avoid other agents to keep their risk of a COVID-19 infection low. The game uses Virtual Reality through a Head-Mounted-Display to deliver an immersive and enjoyable experience. Gamification elements are used to engage the user with the game while they explore various environments. We also implemented visualizations that help the user with social distancing.

                We investigate how Mixed Reality (MR) can be used to guide human body motions, such as in physiotherapy, dancing, or workout applications. While first MR prototypes have shown promising results, many dimensions of the design space behind such applications remain largely unexplored. To better understand this design space, we approach the topic from different angles by contributing three user studies. In particular, we take a closer look at the influence of the perspective, the characteristics of motions, and visual guidance on different user performance measures. Our results indicate that a first-person perspective performs best for all visible motions, whereas the type of visual instruction plays a minor role. From our results we compile a set of considerations that can guide future work on the design of instructions, evaluations, and the technical setup of MR motion guidance systems.

            <div class="abstract">
                Among the many changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most pressing for scientific research concerns user testing. For the researchers who conduct studies with human participants, the requirements for social distancing have created a need for reflecting on methodologies that previously seemed relatively straightforward. It has become clear from the emerging literature on the topic and from first-hand experiences of researchers that the restrictions due to the pandemic affect every aspect of the research pipeline. The current paper offers an initial reflection on user-based research, drawing on the authors' own experiences and on the results of a survey that was conducted among researchers in different disciplines, primarily psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization communities. While this sampling of researchers is by no means comprehensive, the multi-disciplinary approach and the consideration of different aspects of the research pipeline allow us to examine current and future challenges for user-based research. Through an exploration of these issues, this paper also invites others in the VIS-as well as in the wider-research community, to reflect on and discuss the ways in which the current crisis might also present new and previously unexplored opportunities.

            <div class="abstract">
                Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.

                With the growing interest in Immersive Analytics, there is also a need for novel and suitable input modalities for such applications. We explore eye tracking, head tracking, hand motion tracking, and data gloves as input methods for a 2D tracing task and compare them to touch input as a baseline in an exploratory user study (N= 20). We compare these methods in terms of user experience, workload, accuracy, and time required for input. The results show that the input method has a significant influence on these measured variables. While touch input surpasses all other input methods in terms of user experience, workload, and accuracy, eye tracking shows promise in respect of the input time. The results form a starting point for future research investigating input methods.

                Subtitles play a crucial role in cross-lingual distribution of multimedia content and help communicate information where auditory content is not feasible (loud environments, hearing impairments, unknown languages). Established methods utilize text at the bottom of the screen, which may distract from the video. Alternative techniques place captions closer to related content (e.g., faces) but are not applicable to arbitrary videos such as documentations. Hence, we propose to leverage live gaze as indirect input method to adapt captions to individual viewing behavior. We implemented two gaze-adaptive methods and compared them in a user study (n=54) to traditional captions and audio-only videos. The results show that viewers with less experience with captions prefer our gaze-adaptive methods as they assist them in reading. Furthermore, gaze distributions resulting from our methods are closer to natural viewing behavior compared to the traditional approach. Based on these results, we provide design implications for gaze-adaptive captions.

                Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that encode 2D density distributions using color or brightness. Experimental studies have shown though that both of these visual variables are inaccurate when reading and comparing numeric data values. A potential remedy might be to use 3D heatmaps by introducing height as a third dimension to encode the data. Encoding abstract data in 3D, however, poses many problems, too. To better understand this tradeoff, we conducted an empirical study (N=48) to evaluate the user performance of 2D and 3D heatmaps for comparative analysis tasks. We test our conditions on a conventional 2D screen, but also in a virtual reality environment to allow for real stereoscopic vision. Our main results show that 3D heatmaps are superior in terms of error rate when reading and comparing single data items. However, for overview tasks, the well-established 2D heatmap performs better.

                Understanding spoken language can be impeded through factors like noisy environments, hearing impairments or lack of proficiency. Subtitles can help in those cases. However, for fast speech or limited screen size, it might be advantageous to compress the subtitles to their most relevant content. Therefore, we address automatic sentence compression in this paper. We propose a neural network model based on an encoder-decoder approach with the possibility of integrating the desired compression ratio. Using this model, we conduct a user study to investigate the effects of compressed subtitles on user experience. Our results show that compressed subtitles can suffice for comprehension but may pose additional cognitive load.

                Finding relevant documents is essential for researchers of all disciplines. We investigated an approach for supporting searchers in their relevance decision in a digital library by automatically highlighting the most important keywords in abstracts. We conducted an eye-tracking study with 25 subjects and observed very different search and reading behavior which lead to diverse results. Some of the participants liked that highlighted abstracts accelerate their relevance decision, while others found that they disturb the reading flow. What many agree on is that the quality of highlighting is crucial for trust and system credibility.

                The success of modern businesses relies on the quality of their supporting application systems. Continuous application performance management is mandatory to enable efficient problem detection, diagnosis, and resolution during production. In today's age of ubiquitous computing, large fractions of users access application systems from mobile devices, such as phones and tablets. For detecting, diagnosing, and resolving performance and availability problems, an end-to-end view, i.e., traceability of requests starting on the (mobile) clients' devices, is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we propose an approach for end-to-end monitoring of applications from the users' mobile devices to the back end, and diagnosing root-causes of detected performance problems. We extend our previous work on diagnosing performance anti-patterns from execution traces by new metrics and rules. The evaluation of this work shows that our approach successfully detects and diagnoses performance anti-patterns in applications with iOS-based mobile clients. While there are threats to validity to our experiment, our research is a promising starting point for future work.

                Living in our information society poses the challenge of having to deal with a plethora of information. While most content is represented through text, keyword extraction and visualization techniques allow the processing and adjustment of text presentation to the readersâ€™ individual requirements and preferences. In this paper, we investigate four types of text visualizations and their feasibility to give readers an overview before they actually engage with a text: word clouds, highlighting, mind maps, and image collages. In a user study with 50 participants, we assessed the effects of such visualizations on reading comprehension, reading time, and subjective impressions. Results show that (1) mind maps best support readers in getting the gist of a text, (2) they also give better subjective impressions on text content and structure, and (3) highlighting keywords in a text before reading helps to reduce reading time. We discuss a set of guidelines to inform the design of automated systems for creating text visualizations for reader support.

abstract="Living in our information society poses the challenge of having to deal with a plethora of information. While most content is represented through text, keyword extraction and visualization techniques allow the processing and adjustment of text presentation to the readers' individual requirements and preferences. In this paper, we investigate four types of text visualizations and their feasibility to give readers an overview before they actually engage with a text: word clouds, highlighting, mind maps, and image collages. In a user study with 50 participants, we assessed the effects of such visualizations on reading comprehension, reading time, and subjective impressions. Results show that (1) mind maps best support readers in getting the gist of a text, (2) they also give better subjective impressions on text content and structure, and (3) highlighting keywords in a text before reading helps to reduce reading time. We discuss a set of guidelines to inform the design of automated systems for creating text visualizations for reader support.",

                Due to the ever-growing amount of textual information we face in our everyday life, the skill of scanning and absorbing the essence of a piece of text is crucial. We cannot afford to read every text in detail, hence we need to acquire strategies to quickly decide on the importance of a text and how to grasp its content. Additionally, the sheer amount of daily reading makes it hard to remember the gist of every text encountered. Research in psychology has proposed priming as an implicit memory effect where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus. Hence, exposure to contextual information can influence comprehension and recall. In our work we investigate the feasibility of using such an effect to visually present text summaries that are quick to understand and deliver the essence of a text in order to help readers not only make informed decisions about whether to read the text or not, but also to build out more cognitive associations that help to remember the content of the text afterward. In two focus groups we discussed our approach by providing four different visualizations representing the gist and important details of the text. In this paper we introduce the visualizations as well as results of the focus groups.
