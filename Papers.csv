Our approach proposes the enrichment of large scaled MSCs with novel interaction and design techniques used in the field of information visualization. Additionally, we show a graphical solution to visualize parallel, multi-directed communication processes in MSCs. Instead of the common application to specify system behaviours our interactive MSCs are aimed at exploring and diagnosing dependencies in network communication in general and, regarding our special requirements, within in-car communication traces. We implemented a prototype called MSCar with Focus and Context techniques, Dynamic Path Highlighting, Details on Demand and Colour Coding to support the users' cognitive abilities. A qualitative user study on MSCar gave us
preliminary feedback and disclosed potentials of our approach.","@article{sedlmair2008mscar,

In order to help engineers to detect and analyze the potential sources and consequences of errors, it is crucial to provide both comprehensive and detailed insight into the communication processes and their contexts. Two important aspects of these are the dependencies and correlations between onboard functions. In this paper we present a dual-view visualization for exploring the functional dependency chains of in-car communication processes. One view presents the dependencies of hardware components using a space filling approach similar to a treemap, whereas the other view displays the functional correlations as an interactive sequence chart. The views are coupled via color coding and show the dependencies of an interactively selectable functional unit. In an expert evaluation, we assessed the benefits of using this visualization technique for in-car communication diagnostics with very positive results.","@INPROCEEDINGS{4577941,

The Preservation and Conservation Department of the Library has raised concerns about the impact of the environment on the collection. The location of the building in the city centre, large visitor numbers, and the conditions within the building are putting the collection at risk. In developing a strategic plan to find solutions to these problems, the department has been assessing and documenting the current situation. This paper introduces ongoing work on a system to visualise the collected data, which includes: dust levels and dispersion, internal and external temperature and relative humidity levels, and visitor numbers in the Old Library. We are developing a user interface for which the data, originally stored in various file formats, is consolidated in a database which can be explored using a 3D virtual reconstruction of the Old Library. With this novel technique, it is also possible to compare and assess the relationships between the various datasets in context.","@article{ruhland2009libviz,

The explosion of data worldwide affects nearly every part of society, particularly the science, engineering, health, and financial domains. Looking, for instance at the automotive industry, engineers are confronted with the enormously increased complexity of vehicle electronics. Over the years, a large number of advanced functions, such as ACC (adaptive cruise control), rear seat entertainment systems or automatic start/stop engines, has been integrated into the vehicle. Thereby, the functions have been more and more distributed over the vehicle, leading to the introduction of several communication networks. Overlooking all relevant data facets, understanding dependencies, analyzing the flow of messages and tracking down problems in these networks has become a major challenge for automotive engineers.  

Promising approaches to overcome information overload and to provide insight into complex data are Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Visual Analytics (VA). Over the last decades, these research communities spent much effort on developing new methods to help users obtain insight into complex data. However, few of these solutions have yet reached end users, and moving research into practice remains one of the great challenges in visual data analysis. This situation is particularly true for large company settings, where very little is known about additional challenges, obstacles and requirements in InfoVis/VA development and evaluation. Users have to be better integrated into our research processes in terms of adequate requirements analysis, understanding practices and challenges, developing well-directed, user-centered technologies and evaluating their value within a realistic context.  

This dissertation explores a novel InfoVis/VA application area, namely in-car communication networks, and demonstrates how information visualization methods and techniques can help engineers to work with and better understand these networks. Based on a three-year internship with a large automotive company and the close cooperation with domain experts, I grounded a profound understanding of specific challenges, requirements and obstacles for InfoVis/VA application in this area and learned that “designing with not for the people” is highly important for successful solutions. The three main contributions of this dissertation are: (1) An empirical analysis of current working practices of automotive engineers and the derivation of specific design requirements for InfoVis/VA tools; (2) the successful application and evaluation of nine prototypes, including the deployment of five systems; and (3) based on the three-year experience, a set of recommendations for developing and evaluating InfoVis systems in large company settings.

I present ethnographic studies with more than 150 automotive engineers. These studies helped us to understand currently used tools, the underlying data, tasks as well as user groups and to categorize the field into application sub-domains. Based on these findings, we propose implications and recommendations for designing tools to support current practices of automotive network engineers with InfoVis/VA technologies. I also present nine InfoVis design studies that we built and evaluated with automotive domain experts and use them to systematically explore the design space of applying InfoVis to in-car communication networks. Each prototype was developed in a user-centered, participatory process, respectively with a focus on a specific sub-domain of target users with specific data and tasks. Experimental results from studies with real users are presented, that show that the visualization prototypes can improve the engineers’ work in terms of working efficiency, better understanding and novel insights. Based on lessons learned from repeatedly designing and evaluating our tools together with domain experts at a large automotive company, I discuss challenges and present recommendations for deploying and evaluating VA/InfoVis tools in large company settings. I hope that these recommendations can guide other InfoVis researchers and practitioners in similar projects by providing them with new insights, such as the necessity for close integration with current tools and given processes, distributed knowledge and high degree of specialization, and the importance of addressing prevailing mental models and time restrictions. In general, I think that large company settings are a promising and fruitful field for novel InfoVis applications and expect our recommendations to be useful tools for other researchers and tool designers.","@thesis{ediss12448,

Storing and accessing our listening histories is trivial due to services like Last.fm, but learning from them and understanding them is not. Existing solutions operate at a very abstract level and only produce statistics.

LastHistory is an interactive visualization for displaying music listening histories, along with contextual information from personal photos and calendar entries. Its two main user tasks are (1) analysis, with an emphasis on temporal patterns and hypotheses related to musical genre and sequences, and (2) reminiscing, where listening histories and context represent part of one's past. In this design study paper we give an overview of the field of music listening histories and explain their unique characteristics as a type of personal data. We then describe the design rationale, data and view transformations of LastHistory and present the results from both a laband a large-scale online study. We also put listening histories in contrast to other lifelogging data. The resonant and enthusiastic feedback that we received from average users shows a need for making their personal data accessible.

We initially intended to use these measures to provide guidance for the use of dimension reduction (DR) techniques and visual encoding (VE) choices, but found that they failed to produce reliable results. To understand why, we conducted a systematic qualitative data study covering a broad collection of 75 real and synthetic high-dimensional datasets, four DR techniques, and three scatterplot-based visual encodings. Two authors visually inspected over 800 plots to determine whether or not the measures created plausible results. We found that they failed in over half the cases overall, and in over two-thirds of the cases involving real datasets. Using open and axial coding of failure reasons and separability characteristics, we generated a taxonomy of visual cluster separability factors. We iteratively refined its explanatory clarity and power by mapping the studied datasets and success and failure ranges of the measures onto the factor axes. Our taxonomy has four categories, ordered by their ability to influence successors: Scale, Point Distance, Shape, and Position. Each category is split into Within-Cluster factors such as density, curvature, isotropy, and clumpiness, and Between-Cluster factors that arise from the variance of these properties, culminating in the overarching factor of class separation. The resulting taxonomy can be used to guide the design and the evaluation of cluster separation measures.","@article{https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03125.x,

abstract = {Abstract We provide two contributions, a taxonomy of visual cluster separation factors in scatterplots, and an in-depth qualitative evaluation of two recently proposed and validated separation measures. We initially intended to use these measures to provide guidance for the use of dimension reduction (DR) techniques and visual encoding (VE) choices, but found that they failed to produce reliable results. To understand why, we conducted a systematic qualitative data study covering a broad collection of 75 real and synthetic high-dimensional datasets, four DR techniques, and three scatterplot-based visual encodings. Two authors visually inspected over 800 plots to determine whether or not the measures created plausible results. We found that they failed in over half the cases overall, and in over two-thirds of the cases involving real datasets. Using open and axial coding of failure reasons and separability characteristics, we generated a taxonomy of visual cluster separability factors. We iteratively refined its explanatory clarity and power by mapping the studied datasets and success and failure ranges of the measures onto the factor axes. Our taxonomy has four categories, ordered by their ability to influence successors: Scale, Point Distance, Shape, and Position. Each category is split into Within-Cluster factors such as density, curvature, isotropy, and clumpiness, and Between-Cluster factors that arise from the variance of these properties, culminating in the overarching factor of class separation. The resulting taxonomy can be used to guide the design and the evaluation of cluster separation measures.},

In this paper, we contribute the first systematic and broad analysis of DR usage by a sample of real data analysts, along with their needs and problems. We present the results of a two-year qualitative research endeavor, in which we iteratively collected and analyzed a rich corpus of data in the spirit of grounded theory. We interviewed 24 data analysts from different domains and surveyed papers depicting applications of DR. The result is a descriptive taxonomy of DR usage, and concrete real-world usage examples summarized in terms of this taxonomy. We also identify seven gaps where user DR needs are unfulfilled by currently available techniques, and three mismatches where the users do not need offered techniques. At the heart of our taxonomy is a task classification that differentiates between abstract tasks related to point clusters and those related to dimensions. The taxonomy and usage examples are intended to provide a better descriptive understanding of real data analysts practices and needs with regards to DR. The gaps are intended as prescriptive pointers to future research directions, with the most important gaps being a lack of support for users without expertise in the mathematics of DR, and an absence of DR techniques for comparing explicit groups of dimensions or for relating non-linear embeddings to original dimensions.","@article{sedlmair2012dimensionality,

In this paper we reflect on our combined experience of conducting twenty-one design studies, as well as reading and reviewing many more, and on an extensive literature review of other field work methods and methodologies. Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.","@ARTICLE{6327248,

The task and data abstractions that we derived support actively making changes to an overlay network, where logical communication specifications must be mapped to an underlying physical network. These abstractions are very different from the dominant use case in visual network analysis, namely identifying clusters and central nodes, that stems from the domain of social network analysis. Our visualization tool RelEx was created and iteratively refined through a full user-centered design process that included a full problem characterization phase before tool design began, paper prototyping, iterative refinement in close collaboration with expert users for formative evaluation, deployment in the field with real analysts using their own data, usability testing with non-expert users, and summative evaluation at the end of the deployment. In the summative post-deployment study, which entailed domain experts using the tool over several weeks in their daily practice, we documented many examples where the use of RelEx simplified or sped up their work compared to previous practices.","@ARTICLE{6327279,

To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to go back and forth between setting input parameters and qualitatively judging the outcomes of their model. Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions about parameter configurations a tedious and workload-intensive task. ParaGlide endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by guiding data generation using a region-based user interface for parameter sampling and then dividing the model's input parameter space into partitions that represent distinct output behavior. In particular, we found that parameter space partitioning can help model developers to better understand qualitative differences among possibly high-dimensional model outputs. Further, it provides information on parameter sensitivity and facilitates comparison of models. We developed ParaGlide in close collaboration with experts from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and derived a set of tasks and design requirements, then engaged in a user-centered design process, and finally conducted three longitudinal in-depth case studies underlining the usefulness of our approach.","@ARTICLE{6472235,

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.","@ARTICLE{6634108,

With the goal of providing guidance between these visual encoding choices, we conducted an empirical data study in which two human coders manually inspected a broad set of 816 scatterplots derived from 75 datasets, 4 DR techniques, and the 3 previously mentioned scatterplot techniques. Each coder scored all color-coded classes in each scatterplot in terms of their separability from other classes. We analyze the resulting quantitative data with a heatmap approach, and qualitatively discuss interesting scatterplot examples. Our findings reveal that 2D scatterplots are often 'good enough', that is, neither SPLOM nor interactive 3D adds notably more cluster separability with the chosen DR technique. If 2D is not good enough, the most promising approach is to use an alternative DR technique in 2D. Beyond that, SPLOM occasionally adds additional value, and interactive 3D rarely helps but often hurts in terms of poorer class separation and usability. We summarize these results as a workflow model and implications for design. Our results offer guidance to analysts during the DR exploration process.","@ARTICLE{6634128,

The nested blocks and guidelines model extends the previously proposed four-level nested model by adding finer grained structure within each level, providing explicit mechanisms to capture and discuss design decision rationale. Blocks are the outcomes of the design process at a specific level, and guidelines discuss relationships between these blocks. Blocks at the algorithm and technique levels describe design choices, as do data blocks at the abstraction level, whereas task abstraction blocks and domain situation blocks are identified as the outcome of the designer’s understanding of the requirements. In the nested blocks and guidelines model, there are two types of guidelines: within-level guidelines provide comparisons for blocks within the same level, while between-level guidelines provide mappings between adjacent levels of design. We analyze several recent articles using the nested blocks and guidelines model to provide concrete examples of how a researcher can use blocks and guidelines to describe and evaluate visualization research. We also discuss the nested blocks and guidelines model with respect to other design models to clarify its role in visualization design. Using the nested blocks and guidelines model, we pinpoint two implications for visualization evaluation. First, comparison of blocks at the domain level must occur implicitly downstream at the abstraction level; second, comparison between blocks must take into account both upstream assumptions and downstream requirements. Finally, we use the model to analyze two open problems: the need for mid-level task taxonomies to fill in the task blocks at the abstraction level and the need for more guidelines mapping between the algorithm and technique levels.","@article{meyer2015nested,

This paper structures, formalizes, and discusses possibilities to enable user involvement in ongoing computations. Based on a structured characterization of needs regarding intermediate feedback and control, the main contribution is a formalization and comparison of strategies for achieving user involvement for algorithms with different characteristics. In the context of integration, we describe considerations for implementing these strategies either as part of the visualization tool or as part of the algorithm, and we identify requirements and guidelines for the design of algorithmic APIs. To assess the practical applicability, we provide a survey of frequently used algorithm implementations within R regarding the fulfillment of these guidelines. While echoing previous calls for analysis modules which support data exploration more directly, we conclude that a range of pragmatic options for enabling user involvement in ongoing computations exists on both the visualization and algorithm side and should be used.","@ARTICLE{6875995,

This paper contributes to an overview of a possible characterization and abstraction of certain aspects of data-driven journalism in Austria. A case study was conducted based on the dataset of media transparency in Austria. We conducted four semi- structured interviews with Austrian data journalists, as well as an exploratory data analysis of the media transparency dataset. To categorize our findings we used Munzner ́s analytical framework and the Data-User-Task Design Triangle by Miksch and Aigner.

These data are often comprising high-dimensional descriptions of patient conditions and measurements on the success of certain therapies. An important analysis question in such data is to compare and correlate patient conditions and therapy results along with combinations of dimensions. As the number of dimensions is often very large, one needs to map them to a smaller number of relevant dimensions to be more amenable for expert analysis. This is because irrelevant, redundant, and conflicting dimensions can negatively affect effectiveness and efficiency of the analytic process (the so-called curse of dimensionality). However, the possible mappings from high- to low-dimensional spaces are ambiguous. For example, the similarity between patients may change by considering different combinations of relevant dimensions (subspaces). We demonstrate the potential of subspace analysis for the interpretation of high-dimensional medical data. Specifically, we present SubVIS, an interactive tool to visually explore subspace clusters from different perspectives, introduce a novel analysis workflow, and discuss future directions for high-dimensional (medical) data analysis and its visual exploration. We apply the presented workflow to a real-world dataset from the medical domain and show its usefulness with a domain expert evaluation.","@article{hund2016visual,

We found that more than 58% of the 2002 new measures outperform the best state-of-the-art Distance Consistency (DSC) measure. Among the 2002, the best measure is the average proportion of same-class neighbors among the 0.35-Observable Neighbors of each point of the target class (short GONG 0.35 DIR CPT), with a prediction accuracy of 92.9%, which is 11.7% better than DSC.

Recent advances in the field discovered the influential role of two macroscopic topological structures, namely hubs and modules. We propose a visual analytics approach that allows for a systematic exploration of the role of those macroscopic topological structures on the dynamics in excitable networks. Dynamical patterns are discovered using the dynamical features of excitation ratio and co-activation. Our approach is based on the interactive analysis of the correlation of topological and dynamical features using coordinated views. We designed suitable visual encodings for both the topological and the dynamical features. A degree map and an adjacency matrix visualization allow for the interaction with hubs and modules, respectively. A barycentric-coordinates layout and a multi-dimensional scaling approach allow for the analysis of excitation ratio and co-activation, respectively. We demonstrate how the interplay of the visual encodings allows us to quickly reconstruct recent findings in the field within an interactive analysis and even discovered new patterns. We apply our approach to network models of commonly investigated topologies as well as to the structural networks representing the connectomes of different species. We evaluate our approach with domain experts in terms of its intuitiveness, expressiveness, and usefulness.","@article{DBLP:journals/cgf/NgoHL16,

For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.","@ARTICLE{7536217,

While design studies have become a vital component of visualization research, reflecting on actionable contributions from them often poses challenges. The goal of this paper is to better characterize different contributions that can result from design study projects. Towards this goal, a set of seven guiding scenarios for characterizing design study contributions is proposed. The scenarios are meant to help authors identify and depict design study contributions that are interesting and actionable for other visualization researchers. They are also meant to provide better guidance in evaluating design study contributions in the reviewing process.},

As a proof of the course-concept, selected results from formative and summative assessments are presented. The summative results show that students rated the course as one of the best of the 87 computer science courses run in the summer term of 2015 at the University of Vienna. The primary goal of this paper is to provide instructors intrigued by learner-centered approaches with ideas for their own practice.

Consequently, visualization was also of central importance for our exhibition. It was not only used to illustrate the complex simulation data to convey information about the results from the application domains, but we also wanted to teach visitors about visualization itself. Therefore, explaining the purpose and the challenges of visualization research was a significant part of the exhibition. We describe how we developed an engaging experience of a highly theoretic topic using the same visualization tools we developed for the application scientists and how we integrated the venue into our design.

Since OSPRay is purely CPU-based, this adds software-defined visualization to MegaMol. This enables us to use MegaMol for in-situ rendering on HPC systems that lack GPUs. Furthermore, we designed the integration so that the new OSPRay rendering can be used alongside the classical OpenGL-based rendering. We describe how the ray tracing paradigm, where the whole scene has to be available during rendering, changes the module graph of MegaMol. The performance of the OSPRay ray tracing is shown to be at least competitive with classical GPU-accelerated rendering methods for particle rendering available in MegaMol.","@inproceedings{rau17ospray,

However, there is no agreement on the definition or measurement of incivility. Our paper presents an automated sentiment analysis to identify uncivil language and to measure the level of (in)civility in parliamentary speeches. Substantively, we study incivility in the Austrian national parliament during the last two decades (1996-2013) and explore some of the political, institutional and individual factors that affect the level of incivility shown in parliamentary debates. We check whether government/opposition status, the parliamentary role, the type of debate and closeness to the next election has an effect on the level of civility observed in parliament.","@inproceedings{jenny2017incivility,

Low-dimensional representations of the data help, for instance, to explore the class separability and the spatial distribution of the data. Widely-used unsupervised DR methods like PCA do not aim to maximize the class separation, while supervised DR methods like LDA often assume certain spatial distributions and do not take perceptual capabilities of humans into account. These issues make them ineffective for complicated class structures. Towards filling this gap, we present a perception-driven linear dimensionality reduction approach that maximizes the perceived class separation in projections. Our approach builds on recent developments in perception-based separation measures that have achieved good results in imitating human perception. We extend these measures to be density-aware and incorporate them into a customized simulated annealing algorithm, which can rapidly generate a near optimal DR projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to state-of-the-art DR methods on 93 datasets, using both quantitative measure and human judgments. We also provide case studies with class-imbalanced and unlabeled data.","@ARTICLE{7920403,

To this end we couple the DNA hydrodynamically via a raspberry approach to a lattice-Boltzmann fluid and parametrize the counterions with a distant dependent friction. The electrokinetic properties of the CG DNA model inside an infinite cylinder is fitted against experimental data from Smeets et al. and all-atom simulation data from Kesselheim et al.

Prediction results in learning- based sentiment analysis vary strongly. They depend on the choice of algorithm and its parameterization, the quality and quantity of available training data as well as the selection of appropriate input feature representations. Our training data contains human-annotated sentiment scores at the phrase and sentence level. Going beyond the dominant bag-of-words modeling approach in traditional natural language processing, we also test sentiment analysis for neural network-based distributed representations of words. The latter reflect syntactic as well as semantic relatedness, but require huge amounts of training examples. We test both approaches with heterogeneous textual data, compare their success rates and provide conclusions on how to improve the sentiment analysis of political communication.

Parallel sets are used as the basis for the visualization concept, since this is particularly suitable for the visualization of categorical data. The on-demand dimension expands the vertical axis of a parallel coordinate graph into depth axis and is intended to increase comparability of path variables with respect to the number of elements belonging to the respective parameter axis instead of direct comparability of individual paths and keep relations between the parallel sets. The presented implementation suits as foundation for further studies about the usefulness of a dynamic, on demand extension a of 2d visualizations into spatial visualizations.

In our study, we (1) identify different visual labeling strategies for user-centered labeling, (2) investigate strengths and weaknesses of labeling strategies for different labeling tasks and task complexities, and (3) shed light on the effect of using different visual encodings to guide the visual-interactive labeling process. We further compare labeling of single versus multiple instances at a time, and quantify the impact on efficiency. We systematically compare the performance of visual interactive labeling with that of active learning. Our main findings are that visual-interactive labeling can outperform active learning, given the condition that dimension reduction separates well the class distributions. Moreover, using dimension reduction in combination with additional visual encodings that expose the internal state of the learning model turns out to improve the performance of visual-interactive labeling.","@ARTICLE{8019851,

We contrast our framework against cognitive bias codex by Buster Benson. The framework is inspired by Norman’s Human Action Cycle [23] and classifies biases into three levels: perceptual biases, action biases, and social biases. For each of the levels of cognitive processing, we discuss examples of biases from the cognitive science literature, and speculate how they might also be important to the area of visualization. In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist. We hope that the framework will help spark new ideas and discussions on how to proceed studying the important topic of biases in visualization.","@inproceedings{cs5258,

Moreover, labeling is a frequently applied process in visual interactive analysis approaches and visual analytics. However, the strategies for creating labels usually differ between these two fields. This raises the question whether synergies between the different approaches can be attained. In this paper, we study the process of labeling data instances with the user in the loop, from both the machine learning and visual interactive perspective. Based on a review of differences and commonalities, we propose the “visual interactive labeling” (VIAL) process that unifies both approaches. We describe the six major steps of the process and discuss their specific challenges. Additionally, we present two heterogeneous usage scenarios from the novel VIAL perspective, one on metric distance learning and one on object detection in videos. Finally, we discuss general challenges to VIAL and point out necessary work for the realization of future VIAL approaches.","@article{bernard2018vial,

The concept is based on the use of Parallel Sets for the representation of categorical data. By extending the conventional 2D Parallel Sets with a third dimension, correlations between path variables and the related number of items belonging to a specific node can be visualized. Furthermore, the concept uses virtual reality controllers in combination with a head-mounted display to control additional views.

study highlights two classes of users. One which preferred the
interface with the sensitivity feature and one group that does not
prefer the sensitivity feature. We named these two groups the ``risk
fixers'' and the ``sweet spotters'' due to the analysis method they
used. The ``risk fixers'' selected a level of risk which they were
comfortable with while the ``sweet spotters'' tried to find a point
right before the risk increased greatly. Our study shows that exposing
the sensitivity of investment parameters will impact the investment
decision process and increase confidence for these ``sweet spotters.''
We also discuss the implications for design.},

ABSTRACT={<p>Realistic simulations of detailed, biophysics-based, multi-scale models often require very high resolution and, thus, large-scale compute facilities. Existing simulation environments, especially for biomedical applications, are typically designed to allow for high flexibility and generality in model development. Flexibility and model development, however, are often a limiting factor for large-scale simulations. Therefore, new models are typically tested and run on small-scale compute facilities. By using a detailed biophysics-based, chemo-electromechanical skeletal muscle model and the international open-source software library OpenCMISS as an example, we present an approach to upgrade an existing muscle simulation framework from a moderately parallel version toward a massively parallel one that scales both in terms of problem size and in terms of the number of parallel processes. For this purpose, we investigate different modeling, algorithmic and implementational aspects. We present improvements addressing both numerical and parallel scalability. In addition, our approach includes a novel visualization environment which is based on the MegaMol framework and is capable of handling large amounts of simulated data.

An appropriate color mapping is also an important parameter for the creation of an aesthetically pleasing scatterplot. Currently, users of visualization software routinely rely on color mappings that have been pre-defined by the software. A default color mapping, however, cannot ensure an optimal perceptual separability between groups, and sometimes may even lead to a misinterpretation of the data. In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top K suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our assignment technique, we conducted a numerical study and a controlled user study to compare our approach with default color assignments; our findings were verified by two expert studies. The results show that our approach is able to support users in distinguishing cluster numbers faster and more precisely than default assignment methods.","@ARTICLE{8440853,

To overcome these problems, we propose a framework for structure-aware fisheye views. Using edge orientations as constraints for graph layout optimization allows us not only to reduce spatial and temporal distortions during fisheye zooms, but also to improve the readability of the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework enables us to optimize fisheye lenses towards specific tasks and design a family of new lenses: polyfocal, cluster, and path lenses. A GPU implementation lets us process large graphs with up to 15,000 nodes at interactive rates. A comprehensive evaluation, a user study, and two case studies demonstrate that our structure-aware fisheye views improve layout readability and user performance.","@ARTICLE{8440835,

Due to the vast number of available modeling algorithms, an efficient and effective comparison of their results is detrimental to a data- and task-driven selection of a model. LTMA automates this comparative analysis by providing topic matching based on two layers (document-overlap and keyword-similarity), creating a novel topic-match data structure. This data structure builds a basis for model exploration and optimization, thus, allowing for an efficient evaluation of their performance in the context of a given type of text data and task. This is especially important for text types where an annotated gold standard dataset is not readily available and, therefore, quantitative evaluation methods are not applicable. We confirm the usefulness of our technique based on three use cases, namely: (1) the automatic comparative evaluation of topic models, (2) the visual exploration of topic modeling differences, and (3) the optimization of topic modeling results through combining matches.","@INPROCEEDINGS{8534018,

Nowadays, the SES can be rendered at high frame rates using shader-based ray casting on the GPU. However, rendering large molecules or larger molecule complexes requires large amounts of memory that has the potential to exceed the memory limitations of current hardware. Here we show that rendering using CPU ray tracing also reaches interactive frame rates without hard limitations to memory. In our results large molecule complexes can be rendered with only the precomputation of each individual SES, and no further involved representation or transformation. Additionally, we provide advanced visualization techniques like ambient occlusion opacity mapping (AOOM) to enhance the comprehensibility of the molecular structure. CPU ray tracing not only provides very high image quality and global illumination, which is beneficial for the perception of spatial structures, it also opens up the possibility to visualize larger data sets and to render on any HPC cluster. Our results demonstrate that simple instancing of geometry keeps the memory consumption for rendering large molecule complexes low, so the examination of much larger data is also possible.","@inproceedings{10.2312:vcbm.20191249

Our framework facilitates the emulation of various visual deficiencies for a wide range of applications, which allows users with normal vision to experience combinations of conditions such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, cataract, nyctalopia, protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia, and achromatopsia. Our framework provides an infrastructure to encourage researchers to evaluate visualization and other display techniques regarding visual deficiencies, and opens up the field of visual disease simulation to a broader audience. The benefits of our framework are easy integration, configuration, fast prototyping, and portability to new emerging hardware. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we showcase a desktop application and an Android application that transform commodity hardware into glasses for visual deficiency simulation. We expect that this work promotes a greater understanding of visual impairments, leads to better product design for the visually impaired, and forms a basis for research to compensate for these impairments as everyday help.","@INPROCEEDINGS{9044164,

This visual acuity fall-off can be used to achieve higher frame rates by adapting rendering quality to the human visual system. Volume raycasting has unique characteristics, preventing a direct transfer of many traditional foveated rendering techniques. We present an approach that utilizes the visual acuity fall-off to accelerate volume rendering based on Linde-Buzo-Gray sampling and natural neighbor interpolation. First, we measure gaze using a stationary 1200 Hz eye-tracking system. Then, we adapt our sampling and reconstruction strategy to that gaze. Finally, we apply a temporal smoothing filter to attenuate undersampling artifacts since peripheral vision is particularly sensitive to contrast changes and movement. Our approach substantially improves rendering performance with barely perceptible changes in visual quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through performance measurements on various data sets.","@inproceedings {10.2312:evs.20191172,

Subtitles can help in those cases. However, for fast speech or limited screen size, it might be advantageous to compress the subtitles to their most relevant content. Therefore, we address automatic sentence compression in this paper. We propose a neural network model based on an encoder-decoder approach with the possibility of integrating the desired compression ratio. Using this model, we conduct a user study to investigate the effects of compressed subtitles on user experience. Our results show that compressed subtitles can suffice for comprehension but may pose additional cognitive load.","@inproceedings{angerbauer19_interspeech,

These dynamical systems are also influenced by global simulation parameters. We present a visual analytics approach that supports the investigation of the impact of the parameter settings, i.e., how parameter choices change the role of network topology on the simulations' dynamics. To answer this question, we are analyzing ensembles of simulation runs with different parameter settings executed on a given network topology. We relate the nodes' topological structures to their dynamical similarity in a 2D plot based on an interactively defined hierarchy of topological properties and a 1D embedding for the dynamical similarity. We evaluate interactively defined topological groups with respect to matching dynamical behavior, which we visually encode as graphs of the function of the considered simulation parameter. Interactive filtering and coordinated views allow for a detailed analysis of the parameter space with respect to topology-dynamics relations. Our visual analytics approach is applied to scenarios for excitable dynamics on synthetic and real brain connectome networks.","@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/vmv/NgoHL19,

The distribution of work on and across nodes of a supercomputer is crucial to utilize compute resources as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we study two work distribution problems in the context of in situ visualization and jointly assess the performance impact of different variants. First, especially for simulations involving heterogeneous loads across their domain, dynamic load balancing can significantly reduce simulation run times. However, the adjustment of the domain partitioning associated with this also has a direct impact on visualization performance. The exact impact of this side effect is largely unclear a priori as generally different criteria are used for balancing simulation and visualization load. Second, on node level, the adequate allocation of threads to simulation or visualization tasks minimizes the performance drain of the simulation while also enabling timely visualization results. In our case study, we jointly study both work distribution aspects with the visualization framework MegaMol coupled in situ on node level to the molecular dynamics simulation ls1 Mardyn on Stampede2 at TACC.","@inproceedings{rau2019insitu,

"Toward Perception-based Evaluation of Clustering Techniques for Visual Analytics","VIS","2019-12-19","Short Paper","Michael Aupetit","Michael Sedlmair, Mostafa Abbas, Abdelkader Baggag, Halima Bensmail","aupetit2019vis","https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933620",,,,,,,"Automatic clustering techniques play a central role in Visual Analytics by helping analysts to discover interesting patterns in high-dimensional data. Evaluating these clustering techniques, however, is difficult due to the lack of universal ground truth. Instead, clustering approaches are usually evaluated based on a subjective visual judgment of low-dimensional scatterplots of different datasets. As clustering is an inherent human-in-the-loop task, we propose a more systematic way of evaluating clustering algorithms based on quantification of human perception of clusters in 2D scatterplots. The core question we are asking is in how far existing clustering techniques align with clusters perceived by humans. To do so, we build on a dataset from a previous study [1], in which 34 human subjects la-beled 1000 synthetic scatterplots in terms of whether they could see one or more than one cluster. Here, we use this dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art clustering techniques in terms of how far they agree with these human judgments. More specifically, we assess 1437 variants of K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, CLIQUE, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering techniques on these benchmarks data. We get unexpected results. For instance, CLIQUE and DBSCAN are at best in slight agreement on this basic cluster counting task, while model-agnostic Agglomerative clustering can be up to a substantial agreement with human subjects depending on the variants. We discuss how to extend this perception-based clustering benchmark approach, and how it could lead to the design of perception-based clustering techniques that would better support more trustworthy and explainable models of cluster patterns.","@INPROCEEDINGS{8933620,

However, the comparison of class separation for datasets with varying dimensionality is non-trivial, given a) the various possible structural characteristics of datasets and b) the plethora of separation measures that exist. Building upon recent findings in visualization research about the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of class separation for 2D dimensionally reduced data using scatterplots, this research addresses the visual analysis of class separation measures for high-dimensional data. We present SepEx, an interactive visualization approach for the assessment and comparison of class separation measures for multiple datasets. SepEx supports analysts with the comparison of multiple separation measures over many high-dimensional datasets, the effect of dimensionality reduction on measure outputs by supporting nD to 2D comparison, and the comparison of the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods on measure outputs. We demonstrate SepEx in a scenario on 100 two-class 5D datasets with a linearly increasing amount of separation between the classes, illustrating both similarities and nonlinearities across 11 measures.","@inproceedings {10.2312:eurova.20201079,

First, we investigate the sensitivity of scagnostics by employing perturbing operations on more than 60M synthetic and real-world scatterplots. We found that two scagnostic measures, Outlying and Clumpy, are overly sensitive to data binning. To understand how these measures align with human judgments of visual features, we conducted a study with 24 participants, which reveals that i) humans are not sensitive to small perturbations of the data that cause large changes in both measures, and ii) the perception of clumpiness heavily depends on per-cluster topologies and structures. Motivated by these results, we propose Robust Scagnostics (RScag) by combining adaptive binning with a hierarchy-based form of scagnostics. An analysis shows that RScag improves on the robustness of original scagnostics, aligns better with human judgments, and is equally fast as the traditional scagnostic measures.","@ARTICLE{8807247,

To better understand this tradeoff, we conducted an empirical study (N=48) to evaluate the user performance of 2D and 3D heatmaps for comparative analysis tasks. We test our conditions on a conventional 2D screen, but also in a virtual reality environment to allow for real stereoscopic vision. Our main results show that 3D heatmaps are superior in terms of error rate when reading and comparing single data items. However, for overview tasks, the well-established 2D heatmap performs better.},

Our approach employs specialized filters to extract and highlight the development of so-called active galactic nuclei and filament structures formed by the particles. Additionally, we calculate X-ray emission of the evolving structures in a preprocessing step to complement visual analysis.

When analyzing a sequence of multi-dimensional data, e.g., in case of temporal data, the usage of 1D embeddings allows for plotting the entire sequence in a 2D layout. Despite the good performance in generating 2D embeddings, 1D embeddings often exhibit a much lower quality for pattern recognition tasks. We propose to overcome the issue by involving the user to generate 1D embeddings of multi-dimensional data in a two-step procedure: We first generate a 2D embedding and then leave the task of reducing the 2D to a 1D embedding to the user. We demonstrate that an interactive generation of 1D embeddings from 2D projected views can be performed efficiently, effectively, and targeted towards an analysis task. We compare the performance of our approach against automatically generated 1D and 2D embeddings involving a user study for our interactive approach.

Such effects reflect the tendency of humans to take the orthogonal rather than the vertical distance between two curves as their distance. In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that SineStream improves the readability and aesthetics of streamgraphs compared to state-of-the-art methods.","@ARTICLE{9222035,

While other methods separate the creation of colors from their assignment, our approach takes data characteristics into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art palettes with a controlled user study for scatterplots and line charts, furthermore we performed a case study. Our results show that Palettailor, as a fully-automated approach, generates color palettes with a higher discrimination quality than existing approaches. The efficiency of our optimization allows us also to incorporate user modifications into the color selection process.","@ARTICLE{9222351,

"Revisited: Comparison of Empirical Methods to Evaluate Visualizations Supporting Crafting and Assembly Purposes","VIS","2020-10-15","Full Paper","Maximilian Weiß","Katrin Angerbauer, Alexandra Voit, Magdalena Schwarzl, Michael Sedlmair, Sven Mayer","weiss2020revisited","https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030400",,,,,,,"Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","@ARTICLE{9225008,

For the researchers who conduct studies with human participants, the requirements for social distancing have created a need for reflecting on methodologies that previously seemed relatively straightforward. It has become clear from the emerging literature on the topic and from first-hand experiences of researchers that the restrictions due to the pandemic affect every aspect of the research pipeline. The current paper offers an initial reflection on user-based research, drawing on the authors' own experiences and on the results of a survey that was conducted among researchers in different disciplines, primarily psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization communities. While this sampling of researchers is by no means comprehensive, the multi-disciplinary approach and the consideration of different aspects of the research pipeline allow us to examine current and future challenges for user-based research. Through an exploration of these issues, this paper also invites others in the VIS-as well as in the wider-research community, to reflect on and discuss the ways in which the current crisis might also present new and previously unexplored opportunities.","@INPROCEEDINGS{9307759,

Nowadays, many of these visualizations are developed for the web, most commonly using JavaScript as the underlying programming language. So far, only few DR methods have a JavaScript implementation though, necessitating developers to write wrappers around implementations in other languages. In addition, those DR methods that exist in JavaScript libraries, such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, do not offer consistent programming interfaces, hampering the quick integration of different methods. Toward a coherent and comprehensive DR programming framework, we developed an open source JavaScript library named DruidJS. Our library contains implementations of ten different DR algorithms, as well as the required linear algebra techniques, tools, and utilities.","@inproceedings{cutura2020druid,

In doing so, we want to compare pre-evaluation with an approach that seeks to directly map real facial expressions onto their virtual counterparts. To evaluate both approaches, we conduct a controlled lab study with 22 participants. The results show that users are significantly more accurate in judging virtual facial expressions with pre-evaluated mapping. Additionally, participants were slightly more confident when deciding on a presented emotion. We could not find any differences regarding potential Uncanny Valley effects.

In particular, we take a closer look at the influence of the perspective, the characteristics of motions, and visual guidance on different user performance measures. Our results indicate that a first-person perspective performs best for all visible motions, whereas the type of visual instruction plays a minor role.

Although practical, they tend to cause disorientation while navigating. Previous studies show the effectiveness of orientation-supporting tools, such as trails, in reducing such disorientation and reveal different strengths and weaknesses of individual tools. However, to date, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of those tools when teleportation is used as a movement-compensating technique, in particular under consideration of different tasks. In this paper, we compare the effects of three orientation-supporting tools, namely minimap, trail, and heatmap. We conducted a quantitative user study with 48 participants to investigate the accuracy and efficiency when executing four exploration and search tasks. As dependent variables, task performance, completion time, space coverage, amount of revisiting, retracing time, and memorability were measured. Overall, our results indicate that orientation-supporting tools improve task completion times and revisiting behavior. The trail and heatmap tools were particularly useful for speed-focused tasks, minimal revisiting, and space coverage. The minimap increased memorability and especially supported retracing tasks. These results suggest that virtual reality systems should provide orientation aid tailored to the specific tasks of the users.","@INPROCEEDINGS{9284697,

Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-thewild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis. A majority (216/248) of user studies are conducted in a laboratory setting. Often (138/248), such studies involve participants in a static way. However, we also found a fair number (30/248) of in-the-wild studies that involve participants in a mobile fashion.

In formative interviews, we found that tools allowing structuring of observations are often disconnected from the corresponding evidence. Therefore, we designed a sensemaking environment with a flexible observation graph that visually ties together evidence in unstructured documents with the user’s structured knowledge. This is achieved through bi-directional deep links between highlighted document portions and nodes in the observation graph. In a controlled study, we compared users’ sensemaking strategies using either the observation graph or a simple text editor on a large display. Results show that the observation graph represents a holistic, compact representation of users’ observations, which can be linked to unstructured evidence on demand. In contrast, users taking textual notes required much more display space to spatially organize source documents containing unstructured evidence. This implies that spatial organization is a powerful strategy to structure observations even if the available space is limited.","@article{waldner2021iv,

"A Visual Analysis Method of Randomness for Classifying and Ranking Pseudo-Random Number Generators","IS","2021-04-01","Full Paper","Jeaneth Machicao","Quynh Quang Ngo, Vladimir Molchanov, Lars Linsen, Odemir M Bruno","machicao2021a","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2020.10.041",,,,,,,"The development of new pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) has steadily increased over the years. Commonly, PRNGs’ randomness is “measured” by using statistical pass/fail suite tests, but the question remains, which PRNG is the best when compared to others. Existing randomness tests lack means for comparisons between PRNGs, since they are not quantitatively analysing. It is, therefore, an important task to analyze the quality of randomness for each PRNG, or, in general, comparing the randomness property among PRNGs. In this paper, we propose a novel visual approach to analyze PRNGs randomness allowing for a ranking comparison concerning the PRNGs’ quality. Our analysis approach is applied to ensembles of time series which are outcomes of different PRNG runs. The ensembles are generated by using a single PRNG method with different parameter settings or by using different PRNG methods. We propose a similarity metric for PRNG time series for randomness and apply it within an interactive visual approach for analyzing similarities of PRNG time series and relating them to an optimal result of perfect randomness. The interactive analysis leads to an unsupervised classification, from which respective conclusions about the impact of the PRNGs’ parameters or rankings of PRNGs on randomness are derived. We report new findings using our approach in a study of randomness for state-of-the-art numerical PRNGs such as LCG, PCG, SplitMix, Mersenne Twister, and RANDU as well as chaos-based PRNG families such as K-Logistic map and K-Tent map with varying parameter K.","@article{DBLP:journals/isci/MachicaoNMLB21,

We address the visual analysis of class separation measures for both high-dimensional data and its corresponding projections into 2D through dimensionality reduction (DR) methods. Although a plethora of separation measures have been proposed, it is difficult to compare class separation between multiple datasets with different characteristics, multiple separation measures, and multiple DR methods. We present ProSeCo, an interactive visualization approach to support comparison between up to 20 class separation measures and up to 4 DR methods, with respect to any of 7 dataset characteristics: dataset size, dataset dimensions, class counts, class size variability, class size skewness, outlieriness, and real-world vs. synthetically generated data. ProSeCo supports (1) comparing across measures, (2) comparing high-dimensional to dimensionally-reduced 2D data across measures, (3) comparing between different DR methods across measures, (4) partitioning with respect to a dataset characteristic, (5) comparing partitions for a selected characteristic across measures, and (6) inspecting individual datasets in detail.

Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D projections is usually qualitatively decided, by setting projections side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which projection is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating projections, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select 'good' and 'misleading' views between scatterplots of low-level projections of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select projections. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between projections. With this proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank projections on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity in projections selected.","@techreport{morariu2021arxiv,

DDR renders pseudo-document pages by modeling randomized textual and non-textual contents of interest, with user-defined layout and font styles to support joint learning of fine-grained classes. We demonstrate competitive results using our DDR approach to extract nine document classes from the benchmark CS-150 and papers published in two domains, namely annual meetings of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and IEEE Visualization (VIS). We compare DDR to conditions of style mismatch, fewer or more noisy samples that are more easily obtained in the real world. We show that high-fidelity semantic information is not necessary to label semantic classes but style mismatch between train and test can lower model accuracy. Using smaller training samples had a slightly detrimental effect. Finally, network models still achieved high test accuracy when correct labels are diluted towards confusing labels; this behavior hold across several classes. ","@inproceedings{ling2021icdar,

Every year, a vast amount of different techniques, applications, and user studies are published that focus on employing immersive environments for visualizing and analyzing data. Nevertheless, immersive analytics is still a relatively unexplored field that needs more basic research in many aspects and is still viewed with skepticism. Rightly so, because in our opinion, many researchers do not fully exploit the possibilities offered by immersive environments and, on the contrary, sometimes even overestimate the power of immersive visualizations. Although a growing body of papers has demonstrated individual advantages of immersive analytics for specific tasks and problems, the general benefit of using immersive environments for effective analytic tasks remains controversial. In this article, we reflect on when and how immersion may be appropriate for the analysis and present four guiding scenarios.

It is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics. One of those is the venue in which scholarly publications are published. Depending on the perceived (qualitative) or measured (quantitative) prestige associated with a venue, a specific publication will have more or less weight. 

Objectives: We want to understand how visualization researchers consider the prestige of a venue when looking for papers that they could use in their own manuscripts, and how they determine the prestige of any given venue.

Method: We ran an online survey open for 10 days that we sent out to visualization researchers.

Results: We gathered 46 responses from a sample of convenience. We found that publication venue plays the biggest part in how visualization researchers assess research articles. Interestingly, rating systems and metrics are least important criteria for researchers when assessing the quality of a venue. 

Conclusion: We highlight the potential risks around focusing on venue when assessing research articles. We further underline the necessity to discuss with the community on strategies to switch the focus to robustness and reliability to foster better practices and less stressful publishing expectations.

We propose a unified design space for instance selection strategies to support detailed and fine-grained analysis covering both of these perspectives. We identify a concise set of 15 properties, namely measureable characteristics of datasets or of machine learning models applied to them, that cover most of the strategies in these literatures. To quantify these properties, we introduce Property Measures (PM) as fine-grained building blocks that can be used to formalize instance selection strategies. In addition, we present a taxonomy of PMs to support the description, evaluation, and generation of PMs across four dimensions: machine learning (ML) Model Output, Instance Relations, Measure Functionality, and Measure Valence. We also create computational infrastructure to support qualitative visual data analysis: a visual analytics explainer for PMs built around an implementation of PMs using cascades of eight atomic functions. It supports eight analysis tasks, covering the analysis of datasets and ML models using visual comparison within and between PMs and groups of PMs, and over time during the interactive labeling process. We iteratively refined the PM taxonomy, the explainer, and the task abstraction in parallel with each other during a two-year formative process, and show evidence of their utility through a summative evaluation with the same infrastructure. This research builds a formal baseline for the better understanding of the commonalities and differences of instance selection strategies, which can serve as the stepping stone for the synthesis of novel strategies in future work.","@article{bernard2021tiis,

As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.","@inproceedings{cutura2021hagrid,

abstract = {Despite touchscreens being used by billions of people every day, today’s touch-based interactions are limited in their expressiveness as they mostly reduce the rich information of the finger down to a single 2D point. Researchers have proposed using finger orientation as input to overcome these limitations, adding two extra dimensions – the finger’s pitch and yaw angles. While finger orientation has been studied in-depth over the last decade, we describe an updated design space. Therefore, we present expert interviews combined with a literature review to describe the wide range of finger orientation input opportunities. First, we present a comprehensive set of finger orientation input enhanced user interface elements supported by expert interviews. Second, we extract design implications as a result of the additional input parameters. Finally, we introduce a design space for finger orientation input.},

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.","@article{eirich2021vis,

A crucial step of this process is to inspect the model’s accuracy and decide whether it is necessary to label additional elements. In scenarios with no or very little labeled data, visual inspection of the predictions is required. Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation. We found that users outperform traditional automated approaches when estimating a model’s accuracy. Furthermore, while the complexity of images impacts the overall performance, the layout of the items in the plot has little to no effect on estimations.","@inproceedings{grossmann2021vis,

The approach is empirically proven to be powerful for uncovering previously unseen structures in the data. While observing the results of the intermediate optimization steps of DR algorithms, we coincidently discovered the artistic beauty of the DR process. With enthusiasm for the beauty, we decided to look at DR from a generative art lens rather than their technical application aspects and use DR techniques to create artwork. Particularly, we use the optimization process to generate images, by drawing each intermediate step of the optimization process with some opacity over the previous intermediate result. As another alternative input, we used a neural-network model for face-landmark detection, to apply DR to portraits, while maintaining some facial properties, resulting in abstracted facial avatars.

In our interview study, we explored the status quo of VR collaboration in a large automotive company setting with a special focus on the role of avatars. We collected inter-view data from 21 participants, from which we identified challenges of current avatar representations used in our setting. Based on these findings, we discuss design suggestions for avatars in a company setting, which aim to improve social interaction.

We connect AR visualization with data streams from the Internet of Things using distributed dataflow. To this aim, we use reactive programming patterns so that visualizations become context-aware, i.e., they adapt to events coming in from the environment. The resulting authoring system is low-code; it emphasises describing the physical and the virtual world and the dataflow between the elements contained therein.

We construct the map by preserving pairwise distances or by maintaining relative values of specific data attributes. This metaphorical mapping is very flexible and allows us to adapt the visualization to its application and target audience. We present several examples where we map data to different domains and representations. This includes mapping data to cat images, encoding research interests with neural style transfer and representing movies as stars in the night sky. Overall, we find that although metaphors are not as accurate as the traditional techniques, they can help design engaging and personalized visualizations","@inproceedings{10.1145/3491101.3516393,

Four different use cases are analyzed with respect to configuration changes. First, the performance impact of load balancing and resource allocation variants on both simulation and visualization is investigated using the MegaMol framework. Its loose coupling scheme and architecture enable minimally invasive in situ operation without impacting the stability of the simulation with (potentially) experimental visualization code. Second, Volumetric Depth Images (VDIs) are considered: a compact, view-dependent intermediate representation that can efficiently be generated and used for post hoc exploration. A study of their inherent trade-offs regarding size, quality, and generation time provides the basis for parameter optimization. Third, streaming for remote visualization allows a user to monitor the progress of a simulation and to steer visualization parameters. Compression settings are adapted dynamically based on predictions via convolutional neural networks across different parts of images to achieve high frame rates for high-resolution displays like powerwalls. Fourth, different performance prediction models for volume rendering address offline scenarios (like hardware acquisition planning) as well as dynamic adaptation of parameters and load balancing. Finally, the chapter concludes by summarizing overarching approaches and challenges, discussing the potential role that adaptive approaches can play in increasing the efficiency of in situ visualization.","@inproceedings{frey2022parameter,

To fulfill this promise, sensory feedback, such as haptics, is an important component, which is however not well supported yet. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our prototype through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality. Additionally, we conducted a second user study in the field of immersive visualization to investigate the potential benefits of PropellerHand there.","@article{achberger2022touching,

As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose HAGRID, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGRID, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, HAGRID is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.","@article{cutura2022hagrid,

Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D embeddings is usually qualitatively decided, by setting embeddings side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which embedding is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating embeddings, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select “good” and “misleading” views between scatterplots of low-dimensional embeddings of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select embeddings. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics for a supervised machine learning model whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between embeddings. With the model as a proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank embeddings on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity when people select preferred embeddings.","@article{morariu2022predicting,

We consider three overview tasks on networks with 500 nodes: (T1) network class identification, (T2) cluster detection, and (T3) network density estimation, and two detailed tasks: (T4) node in-degree vs. out-degree and (T5) representation mapping, on networks with 50 and 20 nodes, respectively.

While many papers have addressed scalability issues, our survey identifies a lack of consistency in the use of the term in the visualization research community. We address this issue by introducing a consistent terminology meant to help visualization researchers better characterize the scalability aspects in their research. It also helps in providing multiple methods for supporting the claim that a work is ""scalable"". Our model is centered around an effort function with inputs and outputs. The inputs are the problem size and resources, whereas the outputs are the actual efforts, for instance, in terms of computational run time or visual clutter. We select representative examples to illustrate different approaches and facets of what scalability can mean in visualization literature. Finally, targeting the diverse crowd of visualization researchers without a scalability tradition, we provide a set of recommendations for how scalability can be presented in a clear and consistent way to improve fair comparison between visualization techniques and systems and foster reproducibility.

A major hindrance to the use and validity of such studies is Simulator Sickness (SS). Several studies have suggested a positive relation between improvements in simulator fidelity and the likelihood of sickness. We hypothesized that this relation only holds true for static (fixed-base) simulators, and that increased fidelity in fact reduces simulator sickness in dynamic (moving-base) simulators. We performed a meta-analysis investigating the relation between sickness and fidelity in static and dynamic systems. A literature search yielded a total of 41 simulator studies that varied aspects of mechanical and/or visual fidelity and assessed SS for the same driving conditions and the same or equivalent participant groups. Evaluation of a model synthesizing the findings of these studies indicates that SS decreases with visual fidelity, and suggests that this effect may be negated for static simulators. The results of the modeling efforts thereby provide some support for the hypothesis that increased fidelity can reduce SS in dynamic simulators. Based on the evaluation of the literature we also note particular shortcomings and gaps in available research. Finally, we make recommendations for specific experiments that may fill these gaps and allow definitive conclusions on the role of simulator fidelity in SS.","@article{de2022meta,

Instead of generating a whole piece, the AI takes on the role of an assistant that generates short melodies for the composer to choose from and adapt. In an iterative process, the composer queries the AI for continuations or alternative fill-ins, chooses a suggestion, and adds it to the piece. As listening to many suggestions would take time, we explore different ways to visualize them, to allow the composer to focus on the most interesting-looking melodies. We also present the results of a qualitative evaluation with five composers. ","@inproceedings{simeon_rau_2022_7316618,

Users can trigger actions and change parameters via instruments, buttons, and sliders, instead of only inside the code. For instance, toggling a loop or controlling a fading effect through mouse or touch interaction on a screen is faster than editing code. While this kind of control has already been possible with hardware MIDI devices, we provide a more accessible, easy-to-use, and customizable alternative that only requires a web browser. With examples, we show how users perform live-coded music faster and more easily with our design compared to using pure code.","@misc{heyen2022midicontroller,

Traditionally, planning and navigation information is presented using monitors in the surgical theatre. But the monitors force the surgeon to frequently look away from the surgical area. Augmented reality technologies have enabled surgeons to visualise navigation information in-situ. However, burdening the visual field with additional information can be distracting. We propose integrating haptic feedback into a surgical tool handle to enable surgical guidance capabilities. This property reduces the amount of visual information, freeing surgeons to maintain visual attention over the patient and the surgical site. To investigate the feasibility of this guidance paradigm we conducted a pilot study with six subjects. Participants traced paths, pinpointed locations and matched alignments with a mock surgical tool featuring a novel haptic handle. We collected quantitative data, tracking user’s accuracy and time to completion as well as subjective cognitive load. Our results show that haptic feedback can guide participants using a tool to sub-millimetre and sub-degree accuracy with only little training. Participants were able to match a location with an average error of 0.82mm, desired pivot alignments with an average error of 0.83° and desired rotations to 0.46°.","@article{doi:10.1080/21681163.2022.2152372,

Multiple approaches have been developed to tackle this problem, many of which are in common usage in real-world applications, such as in public health networks. However, clear insight into the reasoning behind the community labels produced by these algorithms is rarely provided. Drawing inspiration from the machine learning literature, we aim to provide post-hoc explanations for the outputs of these algorithms using interpretable features of the network. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic methodology that identifies a set of informative features to help explain the output of a community finding algorithm. We apply it to three well-known algorithms, though the methodology is designed to generalise to new approaches. As well as identifying important features for a post-hoc explanation system, we report on the common features found made by the different algorithms and the differences between the approaches.","@article{sadler2022towards,

In industrial environments, the self-representation can be very helpful when reviewing 3D models to conform realistic proportions, particularly in combi-nation with haptic feedback that goes beyond vibrating controllers. For instance, haptic feedback in combination with a virtual representation supports working on use cases where collision is an important part to maintain data quality. To understand the dependency of both, we conducted a pilot study with 15 users from the automotive sector to examine the influence of upper limb representations on haptic feedback in Virtual Reality. Each participant was assigned with one of three upper limb representations which was used in different scenarios using haptic feedback devices. Overall, we found that the realistic arm representation was rated highest in terms of perceived realism and achieved the best task performance.","@INPROCEEDINGS{9974563,

Ideally, MS is studied in a safe and controlled environment, such as a driving simulator. However, only few studies address the suitability of driving simulators to assess MS. In this study, we validate a moving base driving simulator for MS research by comparing the symptoms and time course of MS between a real-road driving scenario and a rendition of this scenario in a driving simulator, using a within-subjects design. 25 participants took part as passengers in an experiment with alternating sections (slaloming, stop-and-go) with normal and provocative driving styles. Participants performed Sudoku puzzles (eyes-off-road) during both scenarios and reported MIsery SCale (MISC) scores at 30 s intervals. Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) scores were collected upon completion of either scenario. Overall, the results indicate that MS was more severe in the car than in the simulator. Nevertheless, significant correlations were found between individual MS in the car and simulator for 3 out of 4 MSAQ symptom categories (0.48 < r < 0.73, p < 0.02), with a strong overall correlation (r = 0.57, p = 0.004). MS onset times were similar between the car and the simulator, and sickness fluctuations as a result of driving style showed a similar pattern between scenarios, albeit more pronounced in the car. Based on observed similarities in MS, we conclude these simulator results to have relative validity. We attribute the observed reduction of MS severity in the simulator to the downscaling of the motion by the Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA). These results suggest that, at least in eyes-off-road conditions, findings on MS from simulator studies may generalize to real vehicles after application of a conversion factor.

In this paper, we propose to use enhanced error visualization, asymptotic path, increasing transparency, and haptic constraint to improve the memorability of motion guidance.

We present a web-based visualization prototype that assists with the planning, training, and analysis of patterns. Its design was iteratively developed with the involvement of experienced formation instructors. The interface offers views of the dancers' positions and orientations, pattern transitions, poses, and analytical information like dance floor utilization and movement distances.

Current evaluation procedures for AR applications rely primarily on questionnaires and interviews, providing qualitative means to assess usability and task solution strategies. Eye tracking extends these existing evaluation methodologies by providing indicators for visual attention to virtual and real elements in the environment. However, the analysis of viewing behavior, especially the comparison of multiple participants, is difficult to achieve in AR. Specifically, the definition of areas of interest (AOIs), which is often a prerequisite for such analysis, is cumbersome and tedious with existing approaches. To address this issue, we present a new visualization approach to define AOIs, label fixations, and investigate the resulting annotated scanpaths. Our approach utilizes automatic annotation of gaze on virtual objects and an image-based approach that also considers spatial context for the manual annotation of objects in the real world. Our results show, that with our approach, eye tracking data from AR scenes can be annotated and analyzed flexibly with respect to data aspects and annotation strategies.","@article {10.1111:cgf.14837,

Toward addressing these challenges, we present a visualization technique that provides complementary views on the movement and eye tracking data recorded from multiple people in realworld environments. Our method is based on a space-time cube visualization and a linked 3D replay of recorded data. We showcase our approach with an experiment that examines how people investigate an artwork collection. The visualization provides insights into how people moved and inspected individual pictures in their spatial context over time. In contrast to existing methods, this analysis is possible for multiple participants without extensive annotation of areas of interest. Our technique was evaluated with a think-aloud experiment to investigate analysis strategies and an interview with domain experts to examine the applicability in other research fields.","@article {10.1111:cgf.14838,

However, it is error-prone due to the multitude of parameters, e.g. different coordinate frames and either position-, velocity- or force-controlled motions on the axes of a frame. We propose a mixed reality based solution, which systematically visualizes the geometric constraints of advanced high-level skills directly in the real-world robotic environment and provides a user interface to create applications efficiently and safely in mixed reality. Therefore, state-machine information is also visualized, and a holographic digital twin allows the user to ad-hoc validate the program via force-enabled simulation. The approach is evaluated on a top hat rail mounting task, proving the capability of the system to handle advanced assembly programming tasks efficiently and tangibly.","@INPROCEEDINGS{10161095,

In den letzten Jahren hat der Automatisierungsgrad in der Vorfertigung unter der Agenda der produktbasierten Bausysteme zugenommen, die ein hohes Potenzial aufweisen, aber in Umgebungen, wo eine höhere Flexibilität erforderlich ist, nur bedingt zielführend sind. Die Realisierung ressourcensparender Entwürfe führt unweigerlich zu kleinen Losgrößen und einmalig zu produzierenden Bauelementen, die für eine effiziente Fabrikation anpassungsfähige Vorfertigungsanlagen für eine Vielzahl von Lösungen erfordern. Am Exzellenzcluster Integratives computerbasiertes Planen und Bauen für die Architektur (IntCDC) werden Methoden erforscht, welche mittels Mensch-Maschine-Kollaboration eine Steigerung von Flexibilität und Adaptivität der Vorfabrikation und Konstruktion von Bauwerken anstreben. Dazu werden neben der Durchführung von Untersuchungen zur Augmented-Reality-Technologie-unterstützten Integration und Kommunikation von Mensch und Maschine auch auf maschinellem Lernen basierende Trainingsmethoden und Vorhersagemodelle entwickelt.

The current generation of planners is confronted with the task of developing new, more sustainable building systems to counteract the problems of resource scarcity, urbanization, climate change and demographic change. In this context, the question of their efficient production using renewable raw materials has become the focus of research efforts. In recent years, the degree of automation in prefabrication has increased under the agenda of product-based building systems, which have a high potential but are of limited use, where greater flexibility is required. The realization of resource-efficient designs inevitably leads to small lot sizes and one-off building elements that require adaptable prefabrication facilities for a variety of solutions for efficient fabrication. At the Cluster of Excellence Integrative Computational Design and Construction for Architecture (IntCDC) methods are being researched which aim to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of prefabrication and construction of buildings by means of human-machine collaboration. To this end, research is also being conducted on the integration and communication of humans and machines supported by augmented reality technology, as well as on training methods and prediction models based on machine learning.","@article{https://doi.org/10.1002/bate.202300070,

abstract = {Abstract Die aktuelle Generation von Planern ist mit der Aufgabe konfrontiert, neue, nachhaltigere Bausysteme zu entwickeln, um der Problematik der Ressourcenknappheit, der Verstädterung, dem Klima-, aber auch dem demografischen Wandel entgegenzuwirken. Hierbei ist die Frage nach deren effizienter Herstellung unter Nutzung nachwachsender Rohstoffe in den Fokus der Forschungsbemühungen gerückt. In den letzten Jahren hat der Automatisierungsgrad in der Vorfertigung unter der Agenda der produktbasierten Bausysteme zugenommen, die ein hohes Potenzial aufweisen, aber in Umgebungen, wo eine höhere Flexibilität erforderlich ist, nur bedingt zielführend sind. Die Realisierung ressourcensparender Entwürfe führt unweigerlich zu kleinen Losgrößen und einmalig zu produzierenden Bauelementen, die für eine effiziente Fabrikation anpassungsfähige Vorfertigungsanlagen für eine Vielzahl von Lösungen erfordern. Am Exzellenzcluster Integratives computerbasiertes Planen und Bauen für die Architektur (IntCDC) werden Methoden erforscht, welche mittels Mensch-Maschine-Kollaboration eine Steigerung von Flexibilität und Adaptivität der Vorfabrikation und Konstruktion von Bauwerken anstreben. Dazu werden neben der Durchführung von Untersuchungen zur Augmented-Reality-Technologie-unterstützten Integration und Kommunikation von Mensch und Maschine auch auf maschinellem Lernen basierende Trainingsmethoden und Vorhersagemodelle entwickelt.}

Over the years, VR has been used in assembly, ergonomic studies, and other automotive use cases to aid development. Engineers already benefit from using VR at different stages of development, but the current setups provide only visual, auditory, and limited vibrotactile feedback on controllers. These feedback types cannot accurately simulate forces for realistic collisions or weight simulation of virtual car components. Despite ongoing research in haptic technology, there are still limitations in creating a perfect haptic feedback system that can accurately simulate all tactile and kinesthetic stimuli without hindering movement or comfort. The automotive industry needs suitable haptic feedback devices, but most research focuses on developing new devices rather than integrating them practically. We conducted four case studies to address this challenge to bridge the gap between haptic research and practical applications in automotive VR tasks. During these studies, we collaborated closely with automotive VR engineers to understand their needs and obtain feedback on using haptic devices. Our approach involved developing new haptic feedback devices based on technique- and problem-driven approaches. We created the PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device that allows forces on the hand without hindering hand use. STRIVE and STROE were developed based on problem-driven approaches, providing string-based haptic feedback devices to simulate collisions and weight. Finally, we created a multimodal haptic feedback system by combining STRIVE, STROE, and the haptic feedback glove SenseGlove, enabling users to simultaneously experience grabbing, weight, and collision feedback. Over three years, we extensively researched and implemented haptic feedback devices in practical settings. We interviewed more than 25 VR experts from the automotive industry, observed over 45 VR use cases, and collected feedback from over 200 individuals who tested our feedback devices. Based on this information, we formulated recommendations for moving haptic research into practice.

Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world.

For overviewing the data, we use dimensionality reduction methods that allow us to plot and compare the different simulations in a scatterplot. To show details about the spatio-temporal data of each individual simulation, we employ a space-time cube volume rendering. All views support linking and brushing interaction to allow users to select and highlight subsets of the data simultaneously across multiple views. We use the resulting interactive, multi-view visual analysis tool to explore the nine simulations and also to compare them to data from experimental setups. Our main findings include new insights into ranking of simulation results with respect to experimental data, and the development of gravity fingers in simulations.","@article{bauer2023visual,

Many approaches focus on analyzing movement data recorded from unstructured situations, such as soccer. For the analysis of choreographed activities like formation dancing, however, the goal differs, as dancers follow specific formations in coordinated movement trajectories. To date, little work exists on how visual analytics methods can support such choreographed performances. To fill this gap, we introduce a new visual approach for planning and assessing dance choreographies. In terms of planning choreographies, we contribute a web application with interactive authoring tools and views for the dancers' positions and orientations, movement trajectories, poses, dance floor utilization, and movement distances. For assessing dancers' real-world movement trajectories, extracted by manual bounding box annotations, we developed a timeline showing aggregated trajectory deviations and a dance floor view for detailed trajectory comparison. Our approach was developed and evaluated in collaboration with dance instructors, showing that introducing visual analytics into this domain promises improvements in training efficiency for the future.

The natural way of interacting in 3D space using direct manipulation with one's hands is hardly employed when abstract data is concerned. In this paper, we explore the idea of directly brushing and linking referents in the real world to analyze abstract data related to the referents. We discuss what brushing & linking means when applied to the real world, including multiple ways of selecting referents (brushing) in augmented reality, as well as different ways of linking with an abstract data view, presented on a dedicated display (a tablet).

Because of its unique way of soft immersion, augmented reality (AR) HMD technology has even more potential to be integrated into the everyday workflow of computational chemists. In this work, we present our environment to explore the prospects of AR in chemistry and general molecular sciences: The chemistry in Augmented Reality package (chARpack). Besides providing an extensible framework, our software focuses on a seamless transition between a 3D stereoscopic view with true 3D interactions and the traditional desktop PC setup to provide users with the best setup for all tasks in their workflow. Using feedback from domain experts, we discuss our design requirements for this kind of hybrid working environment (AR + PC), regarding input, features, degree of immersion, and collaboration.","@article{doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00462,

With our work, we intend to revive interest in this relevant area by presenting a first pilot dataset of annotated triplet comparisons for image quality assessment. It contains one source stimulus together with distorted versions derived from 7 distortion types at 12 levels each. Our crowdsourced and curated dataset contains roughly 50,000 responses to 7,000 triplet comparisons. We show that the multidimensional embedding of the dataset poses a challenge for many established triplet embedding algorithms. Finally, we propose a new reconstruction algorithm, dubbed logistic triplet embedding (LTE) with Tikhonov regularization. It shows promising performance. This study helps researchers to create larger datasets and better embedding techniques for multidimensional image quality.

However, current haptic feedback approaches primarily focus on a single feedback type. This means users must switch between devices to experience haptic stimuli for different feedback types, such as grabbing, collision, or weight simulation. This restriction limits the ability to simulate haptics realistically for complex tasks such as maintenance. To address this issue, we evaluated existing feedback devices based on our requirements analysis to determine which devices are most suitable for simulating these three feedback types. Since no suitable haptic feedback system can simulate all three feedback types simultaneously, we evaluated which devices can be combined. Based on that, we devised a new multi-type haptic feedback system combining three haptic feedback devices. We evaluated the system with different feedback-type combinations through a qualitative expert study involving twelve automotive VR experts. The results showed that combining weight and collision feedback yielded the best and most realistic experience. The study also highlighted technical limitations in current grabbing devices. Our findings provide insights into the effectiveness of haptic device combinations and practical boundaries for automotive virtual reality tasks.","@ARTICLE{10670540,

There are many types of avatars, each serving the purpose of representing users or others in these immersive spaces. However, the optimal approach for these avatars remains unclear. Although consumer applications often use cartoon-like avatars, this trend is not as common in work settings. To gain a better understanding of the kinds of avatars people prefer, three studies were conducted involving both screen-based and virtual reality setups, looking into how social settings might affect the way people choose their avatars. Personalized avatars were created for 91 participants, including 71 employees in the automotive field and 20 participants not affiliated with the company. The research shows that work-type situations influence the chosen avatar. At the same time, a correlation between the type of display medium used to display the avatar or the person’s personality and their avatar choice was not found. Based on the findings, recommendations are made for future avatar representations in work environments and implications and research questions derived that can guide future research.","@article{hube2024a,

Our paper explores ways to improve designers’ interaction with GenAI tools, enabling them to achieve desired outcomes with less effort. We propose two approaches: one that enhances the use of text-based inputs through improved prompt generation with multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and another that introduces more intuitive, visually-driven methods like sketch and doodle inputs, reducing reliance on text prompts. This paper aims to foster discussions on how GenAI tools can better align with the needs of design professionals.

In terms of data, we focus on a continuum-mechanical simulation model involving five different muscles of the human upper arm, with physiologically realistic geometry. In terms of use cases, we focus on the immersive illustration, education, and dissemination of such simulation models. We describe the process of developing six on-body visualization prototypes over a period of five years. For each prototype, we employed different types of motion capture, AR display technologies, and visual encoding approaches, and gathered feedback throughout outreach activities. We reflect on the development of the individual prototypes and summarize lessons learned of our exploration process into the design space of situated on-body visualization.","@ARTICLE{10747503,

"Progressive Data Analysis","Eurographics","2024-11-11","Book","Jean-Daniel Fekete","Danyel Fisher, Michael Sedlmair","fekete2024progressive","https://doi.org/10.2312/pda.20242707",,"https://inria.hal.science/hal-04776568/document",,,,,"We live in an era in which data is abundant and growing rapidly. Big data databases sprawl past memory and computation limits and across distributed systems. To sustain this growth, engineers are designing new hardware and software systems with new storage management and capabilities for predictive computation. Yet, as datasets grow and computations become more complex, response times suffer. These infrastructures, while good for data at scale, do not support exploratory data analysis (EDA) effectively. EDA allows analysts to make sense of data with little or no known model and is essential in many application domains, from network security and fraud detection to epidemiology and preventive medicine. Data exploration is conducted with an iterative loop in which analysts interact with data through computations that return results, usually displayed with visualizations, which the analyst can then interact with again. EDA requires highly responsive system response times: at 500 ms, users typically change their querying behavior; after five or ten seconds, they abandon tasks or lose attention. To address this problem, a new computational paradigm has emerged in the last decade, which goes under several names. In the database community, it is called online aggregation, while among visualization researchers, it has been called progressive, incremental, or iterative visualization. In this book, we will refer to it as Progressive Data Analysis. This paradigm consists of splitting long computations into a series of approximate results that improve over time. In this process, partial or approximate results are rapidly returned to the user and can be interacted with in a fluent and iterative fashion. With the increasing growth in data, such progressive data analysis approaches will become one of the leading paradigms for data exploration systems, but it will also require major changes to algorithms, data structures, and visualization tools. By solving the latency issue, progressive data analysis opens up new perspectives but also presents new challenges. Problems involving complex analyses can now be addressed interactively with little or no preparation time, but how long should the analyst wait before obtaining results that are good enough to make decisions? Can progressive systems provide effective quality measures to avoid either waiting too long or deciding too early? While the progressive process is being computed, the iterative visualization of partial results should remain stable enough to be monitored. Can we stabilize these partial results without hurting their quality or speed? And, more fundamentally, can we transform all data analysis operations so that they become progressive? These questions, among others, are at the core of this book. This book is an introduction to the new paradigm of progressive data analysis and visualization. It explores the major scientific and technical benefits of performing complex data analysis progressively on big data. It also examines the challenges that must be addressed for the paradigm to become fully usable. These important issues involve research fields that are traditionally viewed as separate areas in computer science: databases, scientific computing, machine learning, visualization, statistics, and human-computer interaction; they will need to work together to achieve end to- end solutions to solve these challenges and enable the emergence of practical, progressive systems. This book closes with a research agenda to help researchers converge on key questions. ","@inproceedings{fekete2024progressive,

The main result is the interface MAICO (Music AI Co-creativity), which allows composers and other music creators to interactively generate, explore, select, edit, and compare samples from generative music models. MAICO is based on the idea of visual parameter space analysis and supports the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of short samples of symbolic music from multiple models, displaying them in different metric- and similarity-based layouts. We developed and evaluated MAICO together with a professional composer who actively used it for five months to create, among other things, a composition for the Biennale Arte 2024 in Venice, which was recorded by the Munich Symphonic Orchestra. We discuss our design choices and lessons learned from this endeavor to support Human-AI co-creativity with visual analytics.","@ARTICLE{10878127,

Among different AR display types used for these applications, head-mounted displays (HMDs) and handheld displays (HHDs) are popular solutions. Previous research has examined asymmetrical setups, i.e., two or more people using different types of devices at the same time. However, asymmetrical setups for physical tasks that require collaboration have been little investigated. Our work implements dyadic assembly and sorting tasks supported by simultaneously using an HHD and an HMD. We conducted a user study (N=20) to evaluate this setup. Participants rated both displays’ usability similarly but showed a preference for HMD during both sorting and assembly tasks. While most participants agreed that they collaborated with their partners and the task was easier done in a team, less than half of HMD users in the sorting task agreed with the statement.","@INPROCEEDINGS{10972728,

"Personal Protection Equipment Training as a Virtual Reality Game in Immersive Environments: Development Study and Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","JMIR Serious Games","2025-03-20","Full Paper","Liang Zhou","Haoyang Liu, Mengjie Fan, Jiahao Liu, Xingyao Yu, Xintian Zhao, Shaoxing Zhang","zhou2025personal","https://doi.org/10.2196/69021",,,,,,,"Background:
Proper donning and doffing of personal protection equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene in the correct spatial context of a health facility is important for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections. On-site training is difficult due to the potential infectious risks and shortages of PPE, whereas video-based training lacks immersion which is vital for the familiarization of the environment. Virtual reality (VR) training can support the repeated practice of PPE donning and doffing in an immersive environment that simulates a realistic configuration of a health facility.
Objective:
This study aims to develop and evaluate a VR simulation focusing on the correct event order of PPE donning and doffing, that is, the item and hand hygiene order in the donning and doffing process but not the detailed steps of how to don and doff an item, in an immersive environment that replicates the spatial zoning of a hospital. The VR method should be generic and support customizable sequencing of PPE donning and doffing.
Methods:
An immersive VR PPE training tool was developed by computer scientists and medical experts. The effectiveness of the immersive VR method versus video-based learning was tested in a pilot study as a randomized controlled trial (N=32: VR group, n=16; video-based training, n=16) using questionnaires on spatial-aware event order memorization questions, usability, and task workload. Trajectories of participants in the immersive environment were also recorded for behavior analysis and potential improvements of the real environment of the health facility.
Results:
Comparable sequence memorization scores (VR mean 79.38, SD 12.90 vs video mean 74.38, SD 17.88; P=.37) as well as National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores (VR mean 42.9, SD 13.01 vs video mean 51.50, SD 20.44; P=.16) were observed. The VR group had an above-average usability in the System Usability Scale (mean 74.78>70.0) and was significantly better than the video group (VR mean 74.78, SD 13.58 vs video mean 57.73, SD 21.13; P=.009). The analysis and visualization of trajectories revealed a positive correlation between the length of trajectories and the completion time, but neither correlated to the accuracy of the memorization task. Further user feedback indicated a preference for the VR method over the video-based method. Limitations of and suggestions for improvements in the study were also identified.
Conclusions:
A new immersive VR PPE training method was developed and evaluated against the video-based training. Results of the pilot study indicate that the VR method provides training quality comparable to video-based training and is more usable. In addition, the immersive experience of realistic settings and the flexibility of training configurations make the VR method a promising alternative to video instructions.","@article{zhou2025personal,

However, creating textures for VR platforms remains challenging due to the expertise required for traditional texturing tools and the limited customization options VR platforms provide. This study introduces GenVRTex, a GenAI-driven VR texturing tool that helps novice users generate high-quality textures through text prompts and drawings. Developed through a Design Science Research approach in collaboration with an industrial partner, GenVRTex incorporates ten design guidelines addressing user interaction, prompt control, and texture creation. A qualitative evaluation with nine designers inexperienced in VR texturing confirmed the tool's usability and effectiveness while highlighting potential improvements, including multimodal inputs and iterative GenAI input-output management. This research provides insights into GenAI-VR integration from an HCI perspective and outlines future research directions.","@inproceedings{park2025design,

With Augmented Reality (AR), immersive 3D visualization can be placed in the robot’s intrinsic coordinate system to support robot programming. However, AR interfaces introduce usability challenges. To address these, we introduce a hybrid user interface (HUI) that combines a 2D desktop, a smartphone, and an AR head-mounted display (HMD) application, enabling operators to choose the most suitable device for each sub-task. The evaluation with an expert user study shows that an HUI can enhance efficiency and user experience by selecting the appropriate device for each sub-task. Generally, the HMD is preferred for tasks involving 3D content, the desktop for creating the program structure and parametrization, and the smartphone for mobile parametrization. However, the device selection depends on individual user characteristics and their familiarity with the devices.","@inproceedings{krieglstein2025hybrid,

Parameter sensitivity analysis in this context includes estimating the sensitivity to the individual parameters, that is, to understand which parameters contribute most to changes in output classifications and for which parameter ranges these occur. We propose a novel visual parameter sensitivity analysis approach based on Voronoi cell interfaces between the sample points in the parameter space to tackle the problem. The Voronoi diagram of the sample points in the parameter space is first calculated. We then extract Voronoi cell interfaces which we use to quantify the sensitivity to parameters, considering the class label information of each sample's corresponding output. Multiple visual encodings are then utilized to represent the cell interface transitions and class label distribution, including stacked graphs for local parameter sensitivity. We evaluate the approach's expressiveness and usefulness with case studies for synthetic and real-world datasets.","@article{https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.70122,
