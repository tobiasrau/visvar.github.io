Based on an entered start melody, we automatically generate multiple continuation samples. Repeating this step and in turn generating continuations for these samples results in a tree or graph of melodies. We visualize this structure with two visualizations, where nodes display the piano roll of the corresponding sample. By interacting with these visualizations, the user can quickly listen to, choose, and adapt melodies, to iteratively create a composition. A third visualization provides an overview over larger numbers of samples, allowing for insights into the AI's predictions and the sample space.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{rau2021visual,\r\n  title={Visual Support for Human-{AI} Co-Composition},\r\n  author={Rau, Simeon and Heyen, Frank and Sedlmair, Michael},\r\n  year={2021},\r\n  booktitle={Extended Abstracts for the Late-Breaking Demo Session of the 22nd Int.

To support social interaction, human representations in form of avatars are used in collaborative virtual environment (CVE) tools. However, up to now, the avatar representations often are limited in their design and functionality, which may hinder effective collaboration. In our interview study, we explored the status quo of VR collaboration in a large automotive company setting with a special focus on the role of avatars. We collected interview data from 21 participants, from which we identified challenges of current avatar representations used in our setting. Based on these findings, we discuss design suggestions for avatars in a company setting, which aim to improve social interaction. As opposed to state-of-the-art research, we found that users within the context of a large automotive company have an altered need with respect to avatar representations.","bibtex":""},{"Title":"Illegible Semantics: Exploring the Design Space of Metal Logos","Submission Target":"alt.VIS","Date":"2021-09-03","Type":"","First Author":"Gerrit J.

Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D projections is usually qualitatively decided, by setting projections side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which projection is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating projections, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select 'good' and 'misleading' views between scatterplots of low-level projections of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select projections. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between projections. With this proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank projections on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity in projections selected.","bibtex":""},{"Title":"Perspective Matters: Design Implications for Motion Guidance in Mixed Reality","Submission Target":"ISMAR","Date":"2020-11-09","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Xingyao Yu","Other Authors":"Katrin Angerbauer, Peter Mohr, Denis Kalkofen, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"yu2020perspective","Publisher URL (official)":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9284729","PDF URL (public)":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9284729","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"We investigate how Mixed Reality (MR) can be used to guide human body motions, such as in physiotherapy, dancing, or workout applications.

The current paper offers an initial reflection on user-based research, drawing on the authors' own experiences and on the results of a survey that was conducted among researchers in different disciplines, primarily psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization communities. While this sampling of researchers is by no means comprehensive, the multi-disciplinary approach and the consideration of different aspects of the research pipeline allow us to examine current and future challenges for user-based research.

Nowadays, many of these visualizations are developed for the web, most commonly using JavaScript as the underlying programming language.

In addition, those DR methods that exist in JavaScript libraries, such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, do not offer consistent programming interfaces, hampering the quick integration of different methods. Toward a coherent and comprehensive DR programming framework, we developed an open source JavaScript library named DruidJS.

During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","bibtex":""},{"Title":"ClaVis: An Interactive Visual Comparison System for Classifiers","Submission Target":"AVI","Date":"2020-09-28","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Frank Heyen","Other Authors":"Tanja Munz, Michael Neumann, Daniel Ortega, Ngoc Thang Vu, Daniel Weiskopf, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"heyen2020clavis","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3399715.3399814","PDF URL (public)":"https://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/pumaApi/v1/pages/85bab2ac-cc7e-11e8-806c-000e0c3db68b/publicationLists/8a54995a-d37e-11e8-8d6c-000e0c3db68b/publications/746c5421c7fdafa382be4df6a1b44150/documents/Heyen+-+ClaVis+(2020).pdf","Video":"","Supplemental":"https://github.com/fheyen/clavis","Acknowledgements":"Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Project-ID 251654672 – TRR 161 (A08) and under Germany’s Excellence Strategy – EXC-2075 – 39074001","Abstract":"We propose ClaVis, a visual analytics system for comparative analysis of classification models.

This visual acuity fall-off can be used to achieve higher frame rates by adapting rendering quality to the human visual system. Volume raycasting has unique characteristics, preventing a direct transfer of many traditional foveated rendering techniques. We present an approach that utilizes the visual acuity fall-off to accelerate volume rendering based on Linde-Buzo-Gray sampling and natural neighbor interpolation. First, we measure gaze using a stationary 1200 Hz eye-tracking system. Then, we adapt our sampling and reconstruction strategy to that gaze. Finally, we apply a temporal smoothing filter to attenuate undersampling artifacts since peripheral vision is particularly sensitive to contrast changes and movement. Our approach substantially improves rendering performance with barely perceptible changes in visual quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through performance measurements on various data sets.","bibtex":"@inproceedings {10.2312:evs.20191172,\r\nbooktitle = {EuroVis 2019 - Short Papers},\r\neditor = {Johansson, Jimmy and Sadlo, Filip and Marai, G.

The concept is based on the use of Parallel Sets for the representation of categorical data. By extending the conventional 2D Parallel Sets with a third dimension, correlations between path variables and the related number of items belonging to a specific node can be visualized. Furthermore, the concept uses virtual reality controllers in combination with a head-mounted display to control additional views.

Continuous application performance management is mandatory to enable efficient problem detection, diagnosis, and resolution during production. In today's age of ubiquitous computing, large fractions of users access application systems from mobile devices, such as phones and tablets. For detecting, diagnosing, and resolving performance and availability problems, an end-to-end view, i.e., traceability of requests starting on the (mobile) clients' devices, is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we propose an approach for end-to-end monitoring of applications from the users' mobile devices to the back end, and diagnosing root-causes of detected performance problems. We extend our previous work on diagnosing performance anti-patterns from execution traces by new metrics and rules. The evaluation of this work shows that our approach successfully detects and diagnoses performance anti-patterns in applications with iOS-based mobile clients. While there are threats to validity to our experiment, our research is a promising starting point for future work.","bibtex":""},{"Title":"Text Priming-Effects of Text Visualizations on Readers Prior to Reading","Submission Target":"INTERACT","Date":"2017-09-25","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Tilman Dingler","Other Authors":"Dagmar Kern, Katrin Angerbauer, Albrecht Schmidt","Key (e.g. for file names)":"dingler2017text","Publisher URL (official)":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67687-6_23","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Living in our information society poses the challenge of having to deal with a plethora of information. While most content is represented through text, keyword extraction and visualization techniques allow the processing and adjustment of text presentation to the readers’ individual requirements and preferences. In this paper, we investigate four types of text visualizations and their feasibility to give readers an overview before they actually engage with a text: word clouds, highlighting, mind maps, and image collages. In a user study with 50 participants, we assessed the effects of such visualizations on reading comprehension, reading time, and subjective impressions. Results show that (1) mind maps best support readers in getting the gist of a text, (2) they also give better subjective impressions on text content and structure, and (3) highlighting keywords in a text before reading helps to reduce reading time. We discuss a set of guidelines to inform the design of automated systems for creating text visualizations for reader support.","bibtex":""},{"Title":"A zoomable product browser for elastic displays","Submission Target":"xCoAX","Date":"2017-07-06","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Mathias Müller","Other Authors":"Mandy Keck, Thomas Gründer, Natalie Hube, Rainer Groh","Key (e.g. for file names)":"müller2017a","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"http://2017.xcoax.org/pdf/xcoax2017-Muller.pdf","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"In this paper, we present an interaction and visualization concept for elastic displays.

The basic approach uses a similarity-based search pattern—based on a small set of items, the user refines the search result by examining similar items and exchanging them with items from the current result. A physically-based approach is used to interact with the data by deforming the surface of the elastic display. The presented visualization concept uses glyphs to directly compare items at a glance.

We use categorical data in a multidimensional information space applied in a travel search scenario. Parallel sets are used as the basis for the visualization concept, since this is particularly suitable for the visualization of categorical data. The on-demand dimension expands the vertical axis of a parallel coordinate graph into depth axis and is intended to increase comparability of path variables with respect to the number of elements belonging to the respective parameter axis instead of direct comparability of individual paths and keep relations between the parallel sets. The presented implementation suits as foundation for further studies about the usefulness of a dynamic, on demand extension a of 2d visualizations into spatial visualizations. Furthermore, we present some additional approaches about the usage of the increased visualization space.","bibtex":""},{"Title":"Reduce Simulator Sickness by Overwritten Symbol in Smartphone-Based VR System","Submission Target":"IEEE ICVRV","Date":"2016-09-24","Type":"Workshop / Short Paper","First Author":"Xingyao Yu","Other Authors":"Dongdong Weng, Li Cai","Key (e.g. for file names)":"yu2016reduce","Publisher URL (official)":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7938233","PDF URL (public)":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7938233","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"The aim of this paper is to reduce simulator sickness caused by the low refresh rate of display in smartphone-based VR system.

We cannot afford to read every text in detail, hence we need to acquire strategies to quickly decide on the importance of a text and how to grasp its content. Additionally, the sheer amount of daily reading makes it hard to remember the gist of every text encountered. Research in psychology has proposed priming as an implicit memory effect where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus. Hence, exposure to contextual information can influence comprehension and recall. In our work we investigate the feasibility of using such an effect to visually present text summaries that are quick to understand and deliver the essence of a text in order to help readers not only make informed decisions about whether to read the text or not, but also to build out more cognitive associations that help to remember the content of the text afterward. In two focus groups we discussed our approach by providing four different visualizations representing the gist and important details of the text. In this paper we introduce the visualizations as well as results of the focus groups.","bibtex":""}]
