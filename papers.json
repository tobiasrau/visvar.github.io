We demonstrate the possibility of using flashcard along with an expressive holographic agent on vocabulary learning. Users scan a flashcard and play an animation that is connected with an emotion related to the word they are seeing. Our goal is to propose an alternative to the traditional use of flashcards, and also introduce another way of using AR in the association process.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Using Expressive Avatars to Increase Emotion Recognition: A Pilot Study","Submission Target":"CHI","Date":"2022-04-29","Type":"Late-Breaking Work","First Author":"Natalie Hube","Other Authors":" Kresimir Vidackovic, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"hube2022using","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Virtual avatars are widely used for collaborating in virtual environments.

To provide this information on a virtual avatar, we created a natural audio data set consisting of 17 audio fles from which we then extracted the underlying emotion and lip movement. To conduct a pilot study, we developed a prototypical system that displays the extracted visual parameters and then maps them on a virtual avatar while playing the corresponding audio fle. We tested the system with 5 participants in two conditions: (i) while seeing the virtual avatar only an audio fle was played. (ii) In addition to the audio fle, the extracted facial visual parameters were displayed on the virtual avatar. Our results suggest the validity of using additional visual parameters in the avatars face as it helps to determine emotions. We conclude with a brief discussion on the outcomes and their implications on future work.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Immersive Visual Analysis of Cello Bow Movements","Submission Target":"CHI","Date":"2022-04-29","Type":"Workshop Paper","First Author":"Frank Heyen","Other Authors":"Yannik Kohler, Sebastian Triebener, Sebastian Rigling, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"heyen2022cellovis","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"Funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy - EXC 2075 - 390740016, and by Cyber Valley (InstruData project).","Abstract":"We propose a 3D immersive visualization environment for analyzing the right hand movements of a cello player.

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process.

As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{cutura2021hagrid,\r\n\tauthor = {Cutura, Rene and Morariu, Cristina and Cheng, Zhanglin and Wang, Yunhai and Weiskopf, Daniel and Sedlmair, Michael},\r\n\ttitle = {{Hagrid -- Gridify Scatterplots with Hilbert and Gosper Curves}},\r\n\tyear = {2021},\r\n\tisbn = {9781450386470},\r\n\tpublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\r\n\taddress = {New York, NY, USA},\r\n\turl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3481549.3481569},\r\n\tdoi = {10.1145/3481549.3481569},\r\n\tbooktitle = {The 14th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction},\r\n\tarticleno = {1},\r\n\tnumpages = {8},\r\n\tkeywords = {Grid layout, Neighborhood-preserving., Space-filling curve},\r\n\tlocation = {Potsdam, Germany},\r\n\tseries = {VINCI 2021}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"PropellerHand: Hand-Mounted, Propeller-Based Force Feedback Device","Submission Target":"VINCI","Date":"2021-09-06","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Alexander Achberger","Other Authors":"Frank Heyen, Kresimir Vidackovic, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"achberger2021vinci","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3481549.3481563","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Immersive analytics is a fast growing field that is often applied in virtual reality (VR). VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces.

We identify a concise set of 15 properties, namely measureable characteristics of datasets or of machine learning models applied to them, that cover most of the strategies in these literatures. To quantify these properties, we introduce Property Measures (PM) as fine-grained building blocks that can be used to formalize instance selection strategies. In addition, we present a taxonomy of PMs to support the description, evaluation, and generation of PMs across four dimensions: machine learning (ML) Model Output, Instance Relations, Measure Functionality, and Measure Valence. We also create computational infrastructure to support qualitative visual data analysis: a visual analytics explainer for PMs built around an implementation of PMs using cascades of eight atomic functions. It supports eight analysis tasks, covering the analysis of datasets and ML models using visual comparison within and between PMs and groups of PMs, and over time during the interactive labeling process. We iteratively refined the PM taxonomy, the explainer, and the task abstraction in parallel with each other during a two-year formative process, and show evidence of their utility through a summative evaluation with the same infrastructure.

Every year, a vast amount of different techniques, applications, and user studies are published that focus on employing immersive environments for visualizing and analyzing data. Nevertheless, immersive analytics is still a relatively unexplored field that needs more basic research in many aspects and is still viewed with skepticism. Rightly so, because in our opinion, many researchers do not fully exploit the possibilities offered by immersive environments and, on the contrary, sometimes even overestimate the power of immersive visualizations. Although a growing body of papers has demonstrated individual advantages of immersive analytics for specific tasks and problems, the general benefit of using immersive environments for effective analytic tasks remains controversial. In this article, we reflect on when and how immersion may be appropriate for the analysis and present four guiding scenarios. We report on our experiences, discuss the landscape of assessment strategies, and point out the directions where we believe immersive visualizations have the greatest potential.","bibtex":"@article{kraus2021cga,\r\n\tauthor = {Matthias Kraus and Karsten Klein and Johannes Fuchs and Daniel A Keim and Falk Schreiber and Michael Sedlmair},\r\n\ttitle = {The Value of Immersive Visualization},\r\n    journal={IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (CG\\&A)},\r\n\tvolume={41},\r\n    number={4},\r\n    pages={125-132},\r\n\turl = {https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2021.3075258},\r\n  \tdoi = {10.1109/MCG.2021.3075258},\r\n\tyear = {2021}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"ClustRank: A Visual Quality Measure Trained on Perceptual Data for Sorting Scatterplots by Cluster Patterns","Submission Target":"","Date":"2021-06-01","Type":"Technical Report","First Author":"Mostafa Abbas","Other Authors":"Ehsan Ullah, Abdelkader Baggag, Halima Bensmail, Michael Sedlmair, Michael Aupetit","Key (e.g. for file names)":"abbas2021arxiv","Publisher URL (official)":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00599","PDF URL (public)":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00599.pdf","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Visual quality measures (VQMs) are designed to support analysts by automatically detecting and quantifying patterns in visualizations. We propose a new data-driven technique called ClustRank that allows to rank scatterplots according to visible grouping patterns. Our model first encodes scatterplots in the parametric space of a Gaussian Mixture Model, and then uses a classifier trained on human judgment data to estimate the perceptual complexity of grouping patterns. The numbers of initial mixture components and final combined groups determine the rank of the scatterplot. ClustRank improves on existing VQM techniques by mimicking human judgments on two-Gaussian cluster patterns and gives more accuracy when ranking general cluster patterns in scatterplots. We demonstrate its benefit by analyzing kinship data for genome-wide association studies, a domain in which experts rely on the visual analysis of large sets of scatterplots. We make the three benchmark datasets and the ClustRank VQM available for practical use and further improvements.

Commonly, PRNGs’ randomness is “measured” by using statistical pass/fail suite tests, but the question remains, which PRNG is the best when compared to others. Existing randomness tests lack means for comparisons between PRNGs, since they are not quantitatively analysing. It is, therefore, an important task to analyze the quality of randomness for each PRNG, or, in general, comparing the randomness property among PRNGs. In this paper, we propose a novel visual approach to analyze PRNGs randomness allowing for a ranking comparison concerning the PRNGs’ quality. Our analysis approach is applied to ensembles of time series which are outcomes of different PRNG runs. The ensembles are generated by using a single PRNG method with different parameter settings or by using different PRNG methods. We propose a similarity metric for PRNG time series for randomness and apply it within an interactive visual approach for analyzing similarities of PRNG time series and relating them to an optimal result of perfect randomness. The interactive analysis leads to an unsupervised classification, from which respective conclusions about the impact of the PRNGs’ parameters or rankings of PRNGs on randomness are derived. We report new findings using our approach in a study of randomness for state-of-the-art numerical PRNGs such as LCG, PCG, SplitMix, Mersenne Twister, and RANDU as well as chaos-based PRNG families such as K-Logistic map and K-Tent map with varying parameter K.","bibtex":"@article{DBLP:journals/isci/MachicaoNMLB21,\r\n  author    = {Jeaneth Machicao and\r\n               Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Vladimir Molchanov and\r\n               Lars Linsen and\r\n               Odemir M.

During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Interactive Generation of 1D Emeddings from 2D Multi-dimensional Data Projections","Submission Target":"VMV","Date":"2020-10-06","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Quynh Ngo","Other Authors":"Lars Linsen","Key (e.g. for file names)":"ngo2020interactive","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.2312/vmv.20201190","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Visual analysis of multi-dimensional data is commonly supported by mapping the data to a 2D embedding. When analyzing a sequence of multi-dimensional data, e.g., in case of temporal data, the usage of 1D embeddings allows for plotting the entire sequence in a 2D layout. Despite the good performance in generating 2D embeddings, 1D embeddings often exhibit a much lower quality for pattern recognition tasks. We propose to overcome the issue by involving the user to generate 1D embeddings of multi-dimensional data in a two-step procedure: We first generate a 2D embedding and then leave the task of reducing the 2D to a 1D embedding to the user. We demonstrate that an interactive generation of 1D embeddings from 2D projected views can be performed efficiently, effectively, and targeted towards an analysis task. We compare the performance of our approach against automatically generated 1D and 2D embeddings involving a user study for our interactive approach. We test the 1D approaches when being applied to time-varying multi-dimensional data.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/vmv/NgoL20,\r\n  author    = {Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Lars Linsen},\r\n  editor    = {Jens H.

Hence, we propose to leverage live gaze as indirect input method to adapt captions to individual viewing behavior. We implemented two gaze-adaptive methods and compared them in a user study (n=54) to traditional captions and audio-only videos. The results show that viewers with less experience with captions prefer our gaze-adaptive methods as they assist them in reading.

To answer this question, we are analyzing ensembles of simulation runs with different parameter settings executed on a given network topology. We relate the nodes' topological structures to their dynamical similarity in a 2D plot based on an interactively defined hierarchy of topological properties and a 1D embedding for the dynamical similarity. We evaluate interactively defined topological groups with respect to matching dynamical behavior, which we visually encode as graphs of the function of the considered simulation parameter. Interactive filtering and coordinated views allow for a detailed analysis of the parameter space with respect to topology-dynamics relations.

This visual acuity fall-off can be used to achieve higher frame rates by adapting rendering quality to the human visual system. Volume raycasting has unique characteristics, preventing a direct transfer of many traditional foveated rendering techniques. We present an approach that utilizes the visual acuity fall-off to accelerate volume rendering based on Linde-Buzo-Gray sampling and natural neighbor interpolation. First, we measure gaze using a stationary 1200 Hz eye-tracking system. Then, we adapt our sampling and reconstruction strategy to that gaze. Finally, we apply a temporal smoothing filter to attenuate undersampling artifacts since peripheral vision is particularly sensitive to contrast changes and movement.

Recent advances in the field discovered the influential role of two macroscopic topological structures, namely hubs and modules. We propose a visual analytics approach that allows for a systematic exploration of the role of those macroscopic topological structures on the dynamics in excitable networks. Dynamical patterns are discovered using the dynamical features of excitation ratio and co-activation. Our approach is based on the interactive analysis of the correlation of topological and dynamical features using coordinated views. We designed suitable visual encodings for both the topological and the dynamical features. A degree map and an adjacency matrix visualization allow for the interaction with hubs and modules, respectively. A barycentric-coordinates layout and a multi-dimensional scaling approach allow for the analysis of excitation ratio and co-activation, respectively. We demonstrate how the interplay of the visual encodings allows us to quickly reconstruct recent findings in the field within an interactive analysis and even discovered new patterns. We apply our approach to network models of commonly investigated topologies as well as to the structural networks representing the connectomes of different species. We evaluate our approach with domain experts in terms of its intuitiveness, expressiveness, and usefulness.","bibtex":"@article{DBLP:journals/cgf/NgoHL16,\r\n  author    = {Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Marc{-}Thorsten H{\\\"{u}}tt and\r\n               Lars Linsen},\r\n  title     = {Visual Analysis of Governing Topological Structures in Excitable Network\r\n               Dynamics},\r\n  journal   = {Comput.

We cannot afford to read every text in detail, hence we need to acquire strategies to quickly decide on the importance of a text and how to grasp its content. Additionally, the sheer amount of daily reading makes it hard to remember the gist of every text encountered. Research in psychology has proposed priming as an implicit memory effect where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus. Hence, exposure to contextual information can influence comprehension and recall. In our work we investigate the feasibility of using such an effect to visually present text summaries that are quick to understand and deliver the essence of a text in order to help readers not only make informed decisions about whether to read the text or not, but also to build out more cognitive associations that help to remember the content of the text afterward.
