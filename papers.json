When studying a foreign language, one of the biggest challenges learners face is memorizing new vocabulary. While augmented holograms are a promising means of supporting this memorization process, few studies have explored their potential in the language learning context. We demonstrate the possibility of using flashcard along with an expressive holographic agent on vocabulary learning. Users scan a flashcard and play an animation that is connected with an emotion related to the word they are seeing. Our goal is to propose an alternative to the traditional use of flashcards, and also introduce another way of using AR in the association process.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Immersive Visual Analysis of Cello Bow Movements","Submission Target":"CHI","Date":"2022-04-29","Type":"Workshop Paper","First Author":"Frank Heyen","Other Authors":"Yannik Kohler, Sebastian Triebener, Sebastian Rigling, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"heyen2022cellovis","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.13316","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"Funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy - EXC 2075 - 390740016, and by Cyber Valley (InstruData project).","Abstract":"We propose a 3D immersive visualization environment for analyzing the right hand movements of a cello player. To achieve this, we track the position and orientation of the cello bow and record audio. As movements mostly occur in a shallow volume and the motion is therefore mostly two-dimensional, we use the third dimension to encode time. Our concept further explores various mappings from motion and audio data to spatial and other visual attributes. We work in close cooperation with a cellist and plan to evaluate our prototype through a user study with a group of cellists in the near future.","bibtex":"@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.13316,\r\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2203.13316},\r\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13316},\r\n  author = {Heyen, Frank and Kohler, Yannik and Triebener, Sebastian and Rigling, Sebastian and Sedlmair, Michael},\r\n  keywords = {Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Graphics (cs.GR), FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\r\n  title = {Immersive Visual Analysis of Cello Bow Movements},\r\n  publisher = {arXiv},\r\n  year = {2022},\r\n  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Data-Driven Visual Reflection on Music Instrument Practice","Submission Target":"CHI","Date":"2022-04-29","Type":"Workshop Paper","First Author":"Frank Heyen","Other Authors":"Quynh Ngo, Kuno Kurzhals, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"heyen2022datadriven","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.13320","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"Funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy - EXC 2075 - 390740016, and by Cyber Valley (InstruData project).","Abstract":"We propose a data-driven approach to music instrument practice that allows studying patterns and long-term trends through visualization.

Yet, often these avatars lack expressiveness to determine a state of mind. Prior work has demonstrated efective usage of determining emotions and animated lip movement through analyzing mere audio tracks of spoken words. To provide this information on a virtual avatar, we created a natural audio data set consisting of 17 audio fles from which we then extracted the underlying emotion and lip movement. To conduct a pilot study, we developed a prototypical system that displays the extracted visual parameters and then maps them on a virtual avatar while playing the corresponding audio fle. We tested the system with 5 participants in two conditions: (i) while seeing the virtual avatar only an audio fle was played. (ii) In addition to the audio fle, the extracted facial visual parameters were displayed on the virtual avatar. Our results suggest the validity of using additional visual parameters in the avatars face as it helps to determine emotions. We conclude with a brief discussion on the outcomes and their implications on future work.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Accessibility for Color Vision Deficiencies: Challenges and Findings of a Large Scale Study on Paper Figures","Submission Target":"CHI","Date":"2022-04-28","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Katrin Angerbauer","Other Authors":"Nils Rodrigues, Rene Cutura, Seyda Öney, Nelusa Pathmanathan, Cristina Morariu, Daniel Weiskopf, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"angerbauer2022accessibility","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3502133","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Project-ID 251654672 – TRR 161 (projects A08 and B01).

A crucial step of this process is to inspect the model’s accuracy and decide whether it is necessary to label additional elements.

Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation.

Yet, these devices are still rarely used in practice and it remains an open challenge how to move this research into practice. To that end, we contribute a participatory design study on the use of haptic feedback devices in the automotive industry. Based on a 10-month observing process with 13 engineers, we developed STRIVE, a string-based haptic feedback device. In addition to the design of STRIVE, this process led to a set of requirements for introducing haptic devices into industrial settings, which center around a need for flexibility regarding forces, comfort, and mobility.

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.","bibtex":"@article{eirich2021vis,\r\n\tauthor = {Joscha Eirich and Jakob Bonart and Dominik J{\\\"a}ckle and Michael Sedlmair and Ute Schmid and Kai Fischbach and Tobias Schreck and J{\\\"u}rgen Bernard},\r\n\ttitle = {{IRVINE}: A Design Study on Analyzing Correlation Patterns of Electrical Engines},\r\n\tjournal = {IEEE Trans.

VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{achberger2021vinci,\r\n  author = {Alexander Achberger and Frank Heyen and Kresimir Vidackovic and Michael Sedlmair},\r\n  title = {PropellerHand: {A} Hand-Mounted, Propeller-Based Force Feedback Device},\r\n  booktitle = {International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI)},\r\n  pages     = {4:1--4:8},\r\n  publisher = {ACM},\r\n  year      = {2021},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3481549.3481563},\r\n  doi       = {10.1145/3481549.3481563}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Hagrid — Gridify Scatterplots with Hilbert and Gosper Curves","Submission Target":"VINCI","Date":"2021-09-06","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Rene Cutura","Other Authors":"\r\nCristina Morariu, Zhanglin Cheng, Yunhai Wang, Daniel Weiskopf, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"cutura2021vinci","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3481549.3481569","PDF URL (public)":"https://renecutura.eu/pdfs/hagrid.pdf","Video":"https://youtu.be/E_XP31_JzGY","Supplemental":"https://renecutura.eu/pdfs/hagrid_supplemental.pdf","Acknowledgements":"This work was supported by the BMK FFG ICT of the Future program via the ViSciPub project (no. 867378), and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Project-ID 251654672 – TRR 161.","Abstract":"A common enhancement of scatterplots represents points as small multiples, glyphs, or thumbnail images. As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{cutura2021hagrid,\r\n\tauthor = {Cutura, Rene and Morariu, Cristina and Cheng, Zhanglin and Wang, Yunhai and Weiskopf, Daniel and Sedlmair, Michael},\r\n\ttitle = {{Hagrid -- Gridify Scatterplots with Hilbert and Gosper Curves}},\r\n\tyear = {2021},\r\n\tisbn = {9781450386470},\r\n\tpublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\r\n\taddress = {New York, NY, USA},\r\n\turl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3481549.3481569},\r\n\tdoi = {10.1145/3481549.3481569},\r\n\tbooktitle = {The 14th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction},\r\n\tarticleno = {1},\r\n\tnumpages = {8},\r\n\tkeywords = {Grid layout, Neighborhood-preserving., Space-filling curve},\r\n\tlocation = {Potsdam, Germany},\r\n\tseries = {VINCI 2021}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Don’t Catch It: An Interactive Virtual-Reality Environment to Learn About COVID-19 Measures Using Gamification Elements","Submission Target":"MuC","Date":"2021-09-05","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Christian Krauter","Other Authors":"Jonas Vogelsang, Aimee Sousa Calepso, Katrin Angerbauer, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"krauter2021muc","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3473856.3474031","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"The world is still under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We identify a concise set of 15 properties, namely measureable characteristics of datasets or of machine learning models applied to them, that cover most of the strategies in these literatures. To quantify these properties, we introduce Property Measures (PM) as fine-grained building blocks that can be used to formalize instance selection strategies. In addition, we present a taxonomy of PMs to support the description, evaluation, and generation of PMs across four dimensions: machine learning (ML) Model Output, Instance Relations, Measure Functionality, and Measure Valence. We also create computational infrastructure to support qualitative visual data analysis: a visual analytics explainer for PMs built around an implementation of PMs using cascades of eight atomic functions. It supports eight analysis tasks, covering the analysis of datasets and ML models using visual comparison within and between PMs and groups of PMs, and over time during the interactive labeling process. We iteratively refined the PM taxonomy, the explainer, and the task abstraction in parallel with each other during a two-year formative process, and show evidence of their utility through a summative evaluation with the same infrastructure. This research builds a formal baseline for the better understanding of the commonalities and differences of instance selection strategies, which can serve as the stepping stone for the synthesis of novel strategies in future work.","bibtex":"@article{bernard2021tiis,\r\n\tauthor = {J{\\\"u}rgen Bernard and Marco Hutter and Michael Sedlmair and Matthias Zeppelzauer and Tamara Munzner},\r\n\ttitle = {A Taxonomy of Property Measures to Unify Active Learning and Human-centered Approaches to Data Labeling},\r\n\tjournal = {ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS)},\r\n\tvolume={11},\r\n    number={3-4},\r\n    pages={1--42},\r\n\turl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3439333},\r\n  \tdoi = {10.1145/3439333},\r\n\tyear = {2021}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"The Value of Immersive Visualization","Submission Target":"CG&A","Date":"2021-06-15","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Matthias Kraus","Other Authors":"Karsten Klein, Johannes Fuchs, Daniel A Keim, Falk Schreiber, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"kraus2021cga","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2021.3075258","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"In recent years, research on immersive environments has experienced a new wave of interest, and immersive analytics has been established as a new research field.

Nevertheless, immersive analytics is still a relatively unexplored field that needs more basic research in many aspects and is still viewed with skepticism. Rightly so, because in our opinion, many researchers do not fully exploit the possibilities offered by immersive environments and, on the contrary, sometimes even overestimate the power of immersive visualizations. Although a growing body of papers has demonstrated individual advantages of immersive analytics for specific tasks and problems, the general benefit of using immersive environments for effective analytic tasks remains controversial.

The numbers of initial mixture components and final combined groups determine the rank of the scatterplot. ClustRank improves on existing VQM techniques by mimicking human judgments on two-Gaussian cluster patterns and gives more accuracy when ranking general cluster patterns in scatterplots.

We address the visual analysis of class separation measures for both high-dimensional data and its corresponding projections into 2D through dimensionality reduction (DR) methods.

We present ProSeCo, an interactive visualization approach to support comparison between up to 20 class separation measures and up to 4 DR methods, with respect to any of 7 dataset characteristics: dataset size, dataset dimensions, class counts, class size variability, class size skewness, outlieriness, and real-world vs. synthetically generated data. ProSeCo supports (1) comparing across measures, (2) comparing high-dimensional to dimensionally-reduced 2D data across measures, (3) comparing between different DR methods across measures, (4) partitioning with respect to a dataset characteristic, (5) comparing partitions for a selected characteristic across measures, and (6) inspecting individual datasets in detail.

Commonly, PRNGs’ randomness is “measured” by using statistical pass/fail suite tests, but the question remains, which PRNG is the best when compared to others. Existing randomness tests lack means for comparisons between PRNGs, since they are not quantitatively analysing. It is, therefore, an important task to analyze the quality of randomness for each PRNG, or, in general, comparing the randomness property among PRNGs. In this paper, we propose a novel visual approach to analyze PRNGs randomness allowing for a ranking comparison concerning the PRNGs’ quality. Our analysis approach is applied to ensembles of time series which are outcomes of different PRNG runs. The ensembles are generated by using a single PRNG method with different parameter settings or by using different PRNG methods. We propose a similarity metric for PRNG time series for randomness and apply it within an interactive visual approach for analyzing similarities of PRNG time series and relating them to an optimal result of perfect randomness. The interactive analysis leads to an unsupervised classification, from which respective conclusions about the impact of the PRNGs’ parameters or rankings of PRNGs on randomness are derived. We report new findings using our approach in a study of randomness for state-of-the-art numerical PRNGs such as LCG, PCG, SplitMix, Mersenne Twister, and RANDU as well as chaos-based PRNG families such as K-Logistic map and K-Tent map with varying parameter K.","bibtex":"@article{DBLP:journals/isci/MachicaoNMLB21,\r\n  author    = {Jeaneth Machicao and\r\n               Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Vladimir Molchanov and\r\n               Lars Linsen and\r\n               Odemir M.

Although practical, they tend to cause disorientation while navigating. Previous studies show the effectiveness of orientation-supporting tools, such as trails, in reducing such disorientation and reveal different strengths and weaknesses of individual tools. However, to date, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of those tools when teleportation is used as a movement-compensating technique, in particular under consideration of different tasks. In this paper, we compare the effects of three orientation-supporting tools, namely minimap, trail, and heatmap. We conducted a quantitative user study with 48 participants to investigate the accuracy and efficiency when executing four exploration and search tasks. As dependent variables, task performance, completion time, space coverage, amount of revisiting, retracing time, and memorability were measured. Overall, our results indicate that orientation-supporting tools improve task completion times and revisiting behavior. The trail and heatmap tools were particularly useful for speed-focused tasks, minimal revisiting, and space coverage. The minimap increased memorability and especially supported retracing tasks. These results suggest that virtual reality systems should provide orientation aid tailored to the specific tasks of the users.","bibtex":"@INPROCEEDINGS{9284697,\r\n  author={Kraus, Matthias and Schäfer, Hanna and Meschenmoser, Philipp and Schweitzer, Daniel and Keim, Daniel A. and Sedlmair, Michael and Fuchs, Johannes},\r\n  booktitle={2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)}, \r\n  title={A Comparative Study of Orientation Support Tools in Virtual Reality Environments with Virtual Teleportation}, \r\n  year={2020},\r\n  volume={},\r\n  number={},\r\n  pages={227-238},\r\n  doi={10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00046}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Evaluating Mixed and Augmented Reality: A Systematic Literature Review (2009-2019)","Submission Target":"ISMAR","Date":"2020-12-14","Type":"","First Author":"Leonel Merino","Other Authors":"Magdalena Schwarzl, Matthias Kraus, Michael Sedlmair, Dieter Schmalstieg, Daniel Weiskopf","Key (e.g. for file names)":"merino2020ismar","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00069","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"We present a systematic review of 45S papers that report on evaluations in mixed and augmented reality (MR/AR) published in ISMAR, CHI, IEEE VR, and UIST over a span of 11 years (2009-2019).

During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"SineStream: Improving the Readability of Streamgraphs by Minimizing Sine Illusion Effects","Submission Target":"TVCG","Date":"2020-10-13","Type":"","First Author":"Chuan Bu","Other Authors":"Quanjie Zhang, Qianwen Wang, Jian Zhang, Oliver Deussen, Michael Sedlmair, Yunhai Wang","Key (e.g. for file names)":"bu2021sinestream","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030404","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"In this paper, we propose SineStream, a new variant of streamgraphs that improves their readability by minimizing sine illusion effects.

As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes.

Despite the good performance in generating 2D embeddings, 1D embeddings often exhibit a much lower quality for pattern recognition tasks. We propose to overcome the issue by involving the user to generate 1D embeddings of multi-dimensional data in a two-step procedure: We first generate a 2D embedding and then leave the task of reducing the 2D to a 1D embedding to the user. We demonstrate that an interactive generation of 1D embeddings from 2D projected views can be performed efficiently, effectively, and targeted towards an analysis task. We compare the performance of our approach against automatically generated 1D and 2D embeddings involving a user study for our interactive approach. We test the 1D approaches when being applied to time-varying multi-dimensional data.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/vmv/NgoL20,\r\n  author    = {Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Lars Linsen},\r\n  editor    = {Jens H.

Alternative techniques place captions closer to related content (e.g., faces) but are not applicable to arbitrary videos such as documentations. Hence, we propose to leverage live gaze as indirect input method to adapt captions to individual viewing behavior. We implemented two gaze-adaptive methods and compared them in a user study (n=54) to traditional captions and audio-only videos. The results show that viewers with less experience with captions prefer our gaze-adaptive methods as they assist them in reading. Furthermore, gaze distributions resulting from our methods are closer to natural viewing behavior compared to the traditional approach.

We apply our methods to the well-studied approach of dynamical billiards for validation and to the novel approach of symplectic billiards for new observations.","bibtex":"@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/grapp/Boshe-PloisNAL20,\r\n  author    = {Stefan Boshe{-}Plois and\r\n               Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Peter Albers and\r\n               Lars Linsen},\r\n  editor    = {Andreas Kerren and\r\n               Christophe Hurter and\r\n               Jos{\\'{e}} Braz},\r\n  title     = {Visual Analysis of Billiard Dynamics Simulation Ensembles},\r\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 15th International Joint Conference on Computer\r\n               Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications, {VISIGRAPP}\r\n               2020, Volume 3: IVAPP, Valletta, Malta, February 27-29, 2020},\r\n  pages     = {185--192},\r\n  publisher = {{SCITEPRESS}},\r\n  year      = {2020},\r\n  url       = {https://doi.org/10.5220/0008956201850192},\r\n  doi       = {10.5220/0008956201850192},\r\n  timestamp = {Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:03:30 +0200},\r\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/conf/grapp/Boshe-PloisNAL20.bib},\r\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Improving the Robustness of Scagnostics","Submission Target":"TVCG","Date":"2020-01-00","Type":"","First Author":"Yunhai Wang","Other Authors":"Zeyu Wang, Tingting Liu, Michael Correll, Zhanglin Cheng, Oliver Deussen, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"wang2020scag","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934796","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"In this paper, we examine the robustness of scagnostics through a series of theoretical and empirical studies. First, we investigate the sensitivity of scagnostics by employing perturbing operations on more than 60M synthetic and real-world scatterplots. We found that two scagnostic measures, Outlying and Clumpy, are overly sensitive to data binning. To understand how these measures align with human judgments of visual features, we conducted a study with 24 participants, which reveals that i) humans are not sensitive to small perturbations of the data that cause large changes in both measures, and ii) the perception of clumpiness heavily depends on per-cluster topologies and structures. Motivated by these results, we propose Robust Scagnostics (RScag) by combining adaptive binning with a hierarchy-based form of scagnostics. An analysis shows that RScag improves on the robustness of original scagnostics, aligns better with human judgments, and is equally fast as the traditional scagnostic measures.","bibtex":"@ARTICLE{8807247,\r\n  author={Wang, Yunhai and Wang, Zeyu and Liu, Tingting and Correll, Michael and Cheng, Zhanglin and Deussen, Oliver and Sedlmair, Michael},\r\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, \r\n  title={Improving the Robustness of Scagnostics}, \r\n  year={2020},\r\n  volume={26},\r\n  number={1},\r\n  pages={759-769},\r\n  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934796}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"SepEx: Visual Analysis of Class Separation Measures","Submission Target":"EuroVA","Date":"2020-00-00","Type":"","First Author":"Jürgen Bernard","Other Authors":"Marco Hutter, Matthias Zeppelzauer, Michael Sedlmair, Tamara Munzner","Key (e.g. for file names)":"bernard2020eurova","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.2312/eurova.20201079","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Class separation is an important concept in machine learning and visual analytics.

Evaluating these clustering techniques, however, is difficult due to the lack of universal ground truth. Instead, clustering approaches are usually evaluated based on a subjective visual judgment of low-dimensional scatterplots of different datasets. As clustering is an inherent human-in-the-loop task, we propose a more systematic way of evaluating clustering algorithms based on quantification of human perception of clusters in 2D scatterplots. The core question we are asking is in how far existing clustering techniques align with clusters perceived by humans. To do so, we build on a dataset from a previous study [1], in which 34 human subjects la-beled 1000 synthetic scatterplots in terms of whether they could see one or more than one cluster. Here, we use this dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art clustering techniques in terms of how far they agree with these human judgments. More specifically, we assess 1437 variants of K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, CLIQUE, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering techniques on these benchmarks data. We get unexpected results. For instance, CLIQUE and DBSCAN are at best in slight agreement on this basic cluster counting task, while model-agnostic Agglomerative clustering can be up to a substantial agreement with human subjects depending on the variants. We discuss how to extend this perception-based clustering benchmark approach, and how it could lead to the design of perception-based clustering techniques that would better support more trustworthy and explainable models of cluster patterns.","bibtex":"@INPROCEEDINGS{8933620,\r\n  author={Aupetit, Michaël and Sedlmair, Michael and Abbas, Mostafa M. and Baggag, Abdelkader and Bensmail, Halima},\r\n  booktitle={2019 IEEE Visualization Conference (VIS)}, \r\n  title={Toward Perception-Based Evaluation of Clustering Techniques for Visual Analytics}, \r\n  year={2019},\r\n  pages={141-145},\r\n  doi={10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933620}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Network Visualization","Submission Target":"In Network Science - An Aerial View, Springer","Date":"2019-11-20","Type":"Book Chapter","First Author":"Ulrik Brandes","Other Authors":"Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"brandes2019netvis","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26814-5_2","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Data visualization is the art and science of mapping data to graphical variables.

We present a visual analytics approach that supports the investigation of the impact of the parameter settings, i.e., how parameter choices change the role of network topology on the simulations' dynamics. To answer this question, we are analyzing ensembles of simulation runs with different parameter settings executed on a given network topology. We relate the nodes' topological structures to their dynamical similarity in a 2D plot based on an interactively defined hierarchy of topological properties and a 1D embedding for the dynamical similarity. We evaluate interactively defined topological groups with respect to matching dynamical behavior, which we visually encode as graphs of the function of the considered simulation parameter. Interactive filtering and coordinated views allow for a detailed analysis of the parameter space with respect to topology-dynamics relations.

Volume raycasting has unique characteristics, preventing a direct transfer of many traditional foveated rendering techniques. We present an approach that utilizes the visual acuity fall-off to accelerate volume rendering based on Linde-Buzo-Gray sampling and natural neighbor interpolation. First, we measure gaze using a stationary 1200 Hz eye-tracking system. Then, we adapt our sampling and reconstruction strategy to that gaze. Finally, we apply a temporal smoothing filter to attenuate undersampling artifacts since peripheral vision is particularly sensitive to contrast changes and movement. Our approach substantially improves rendering performance with barely perceptible changes in visual quality.

Yet, the effect size of this neighborhood effect is small compared to other data-inherent effects: the judgment accuracy largely depends on the target bar rank, number of data items, and other data characteristics of the dataset. Based on the findings, we discuss design implications for perceptually optimizing bar charts.},\r\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\r\npages = {1–12},\r\nnumpages = {12},\r\nkeywords = {visualization, empirical study that tells us about people},\r\nlocation = {Glasgow, Scotland Uk},\r\nseries = {CHI '19}\r\n}","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"A Framework for Pervasive Visual Deficiency Simulation","Submission Target":"VR","Date":"2019-03-23","Type":"","First Author":"Christoph Schulz","Other Authors":"Nils Rodrigues, Marco Amann, Daniel Baumgartner, Arman Mielke, Christian Baumann, Michael Sedlmair, Daniel Weiskopf","Key (e.g. for file names)":"schulz2019deficiencySim","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VR44988.2019.9044164","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"We present a framework for rapid prototyping of pervasive visual deficiency simulation in the context of graphical interfaces, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

Our framework provides an infrastructure to encourage researchers to evaluate visualization and other display techniques regarding visual deficiencies, and opens up the field of visual disease simulation to a broader audience. The benefits of our framework are easy integration, configuration, fast prototyping, and portability to new emerging hardware. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we showcase a desktop application and an Android application that transform commodity hardware into glasses for visual deficiency simulation.

This data structure builds a basis for model exploration and optimization, thus, allowing for an efficient evaluation of their performance in the context of a given type of text data and task.

An appropriate color mapping is also an important parameter for the creation of an aesthetically pleasing scatterplot. Currently, users of visualization software routinely rely on color mappings that have been pre-defined by the software. A default color mapping, however, cannot ensure an optimal perceptual separability between groups, and sometimes may even lead to a misinterpretation of the data. In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top K suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our assignment technique, we conducted a numerical study and a controlled user study to compare our approach with default color assignments; our findings were verified by two expert studies. The results show that our approach is able to support users in distinguishing cluster numbers faster and more precisely than default assignment methods.","bibtex":"@ARTICLE{8440853,\r\n  author={Wang, Yunhai and Chen, Xin and Ge, Tong and Bao, Chen and Sedlmair, Michael and Fu, Chi-Wing and Deussen, Oliver and Chen, Baoquan},\r\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, \r\n  title={Optimizing Color Assignment for Perception of Class Separability in Multiclass Scatterplots}, \r\n  year={2019},\r\n  volume={25},\r\n  number={1},\r\n  pages={820-829},\r\n  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864912}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Towards User-Centered Active Learning Algorithms","Submission Target":"CGF","Date":"2018-07-11","Type":"","First Author":"Jürgen Bernard","Other Authors":"Matthias Zeppelzauer, Markus Lehmann, Martin Müller, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"bernard2018eurovis","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13406","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"The labeling of data sets is a time-consuming task, which is, however, an important prerequisite for machine learning and visual analytics.

The on-demand dimension expands the vertical axis of a parallel coordinate graph into depth axis and is intended to increase comparability of path variables with respect to the number of elements belonging to the respective parameter axis instead of direct comparability of individual paths and keep relations between the parallel sets. The presented implementation suits as foundation for further studies about the usefulness of a dynamic, on demand extension a of 2d visualizations into spatial visualizations.

Low-dimensional representations of the data help, for instance, to explore the class separability and the spatial distribution of the data. Widely-used unsupervised DR methods like PCA do not aim to maximize the class separation, while supervised DR methods like LDA often assume certain spatial distributions and do not take perceptual capabilities of humans into account. These issues make them ineffective for complicated class structures. Towards filling this gap, we present a perception-driven linear dimensionality reduction approach that maximizes the perceived class separation in projections. Our approach builds on recent developments in perception-based separation measures that have achieved good results in imitating human perception. We extend these measures to be density-aware and incorporate them into a customized simulated annealing algorithm, which can rapidly generate a near optimal DR projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to state-of-the-art DR methods on 93 datasets, using both quantitative measure and human judgments. We also provide case studies with class-imbalanced and unlabeled data.","bibtex":"@ARTICLE{7920403,\r\n  author={Wang, Yunhai and Feng, Kang and Chu, Xiaowei and Zhang, Jian and Fu, Chi-Wing and Sedlmair, Michael and Yu, Xiaohui and Chen, Baoquan},\r\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, \r\n  title={A Perception-Driven Approach to Supervised Dimensionality Reduction for Visualization}, \r\n  year={2018},\r\n  volume={24},\r\n  number={5},\r\n  pages={1828-1840},\r\n  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2017.2701829}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Incivility in Austrian parliamentary debates: A supervised sentiment analysis of parliamentary speeches","Submission Target":"ECPR","Date":"2017-04-25","Type":"","First Author":"Marcelo Jenny","Other Authors":"Martin Haselmayer, Elena Rudkowsky, Matthias Wastian, Stefan Emrich, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"jenny2017incivility","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Incivility of political communication has become a major topic in public and scientific discourse (e.g. Herbst 2010; Berry and Sobieraj 2013), and it is often seen as a cause of increasing political polarization, lower electoral turnout and voter disaffection with politics and democracy in general (Jamieson 1992; Kahn and Kenny 1999; Mutz and Reeves 2005, Mutz 2007; Brooks and Geer 2007; Lau and Rovner 2009; Harcourt 2012).

For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.","bibtex":"@ARTICLE{7536217,\r\n  author={Sacha, Dominik and Zhang, Leishi and Sedlmair, Michael and Lee, John A. and Peltonen, Jaakko and Weiskopf, Daniel and North, Stephen C. and Keim, Daniel A.},\r\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, \r\n  title={Visual Interaction with Dimensionality Reduction: A Structured Literature Analysis}, \r\n  year={2017},\r\n  volume={23},\r\n  number={1},\r\n  pages={241-250},\r\n  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598495}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Virtual UNREALity: Exploring Alternative Visualization Techniques for Virtual Reality","Submission Target":"xCoAX","Date":"2016-07-07","Type":"Full Paper","First Author":"Natalie Hube","Other Authors":"Hannes Grusla, Mathias Müller, Ingmar S.

We propose a visual analytics approach that allows for a systematic exploration of the role of those macroscopic topological structures on the dynamics in excitable networks. Dynamical patterns are discovered using the dynamical features of excitation ratio and co-activation. Our approach is based on the interactive analysis of the correlation of topological and dynamical features using coordinated views. We designed suitable visual encodings for both the topological and the dynamical features. A degree map and an adjacency matrix visualization allow for the interaction with hubs and modules, respectively. A barycentric-coordinates layout and a multi-dimensional scaling approach allow for the analysis of excitation ratio and co-activation, respectively. We demonstrate how the interplay of the visual encodings allows us to quickly reconstruct recent findings in the field within an interactive analysis and even discovered new patterns. We apply our approach to network models of commonly investigated topologies as well as to the structural networks representing the connectomes of different species. We evaluate our approach with domain experts in terms of its intuitiveness, expressiveness, and usefulness.","bibtex":"@article{DBLP:journals/cgf/NgoHL16,\r\n  author    = {Quynh Quang Ngo and\r\n               Marc{-}Thorsten H{\\\"{u}}tt and\r\n               Lars Linsen},\r\n  title     = {Visual Analysis of Governing Topological Structures in Excitable Network\r\n               Dynamics},\r\n  journal   = {Comput.

These data are often comprising high-dimensional descriptions of patient conditions and measurements on the success of certain therapies. An important analysis question in such data is to compare and correlate patient conditions and therapy results along with combinations of dimensions. As the number of dimensions is often very large, one needs to map them to a smaller number of relevant dimensions to be more amenable for expert analysis. This is because irrelevant, redundant, and conflicting dimensions can negatively affect effectiveness and efficiency of the analytic process (the so-called curse of dimensionality). However, the possible mappings from high- to low-dimensional spaces are ambiguous. For example, the similarity between patients may change by considering different combinations of relevant dimensions (subspaces). We demonstrate the potential of subspace analysis for the interpretation of high-dimensional medical data. Specifically, we present SubVIS, an interactive tool to visually explore subspace clusters from different perspectives, introduce a novel analysis workflow, and discuss future directions for high-dimensional (medical) data analysis and its visual exploration. We apply the presented workflow to a real-world dataset from the medical domain and show its usefulness with a domain expert evaluation.","bibtex":"@article{hund2016visual,\r\n  title={Visual analytics for concept exploration in subspaces of patient groups},\r\n  author={Hund, Michael and B{\\\"o}hm, Dominic and Sturm, Werner and Sedlmair, Michael and Schreck, Tobias and Ullrich, Torsten and Keim, Daniel A and Majnaric, Ljiljana and Holzinger, Andreas},\r\n  journal={Brain Informatics},\r\n  volume={3},\r\n  number={4},\r\n  pages={233--247},\r\n  year={2016},\r\n  publisher={SpringerOpen}\r\n}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"TagFlip: Active Mobile Music Discovery with Social Tags","Submission Target":"IUI","Date":"2016-03-07","Type":"","First Author":"Mohsen Kamalzadeh","Other Authors":"Christoph Kralj, Torsten Möller, Michael Sedlmair","Key (e.g. for file names)":"kamalzadeh2016tagflip","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2856767.2856780","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"We report on the design and evaluation of TagFlip, a novel interface for active music discovery based on social tags of music.

We cannot afford to read every text in detail, hence we need to acquire strategies to quickly decide on the importance of a text and how to grasp its content. Additionally, the sheer amount of daily reading makes it hard to remember the gist of every text encountered. Research in psychology has proposed priming as an implicit memory effect where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus. Hence, exposure to contextual information can influence comprehension and recall. In our work we investigate the feasibility of using such an effect to visually present text summaries that are quick to understand and deliver the essence of a text in order to help readers not only make informed decisions about whether to read the text or not, but also to build out more cognitive associations that help to remember the content of the text afterward.

The nested blocks and guidelines model extends the previously proposed four-level nested model by adding finer grained structure within each level, providing explicit mechanisms to capture and discuss design decision rationale. Blocks are the outcomes of the design process at a specific level, and guidelines discuss relationships between these blocks. Blocks at the algorithm and technique levels describe design choices, as do data blocks at the abstraction level, whereas task abstraction blocks and domain situation blocks are identified as the outcome of the designer’s understanding of the requirements. In the nested blocks and guidelines model, there are two types of guidelines: within-level guidelines provide comparisons for blocks within the same level, while between-level guidelines provide mappings between adjacent levels of design. We analyze several recent articles using the nested blocks and guidelines model to provide concrete examples of how a researcher can use blocks and guidelines to describe and evaluate visualization research. We also discuss the nested blocks and guidelines model with respect to other design models to clarify its role in visualization design. Using the nested blocks and guidelines model, we pinpoint two implications for visualization evaluation. First, comparison of blocks at the domain level must occur implicitly downstream at the abstraction level; second, comparison between blocks must take into account both upstream assumptions and downstream requirements. Finally, we use the model to analyze two open problems: the need for mid-level task taxonomies to fill in the task blocks at the abstraction level and the need for more guidelines mapping between the algorithm and technique levels.","bibtex":"@article{meyer2015nested,\r\n  title={The nested blocks and guidelines model},\r\n  author={Meyer, Miriah and Sedlmair, Michael and Quinan, P Samuel and Munzner, Tamara},\r\n  journal={Information Visualization},\r\n  volume={14},\r\n  number={3},\r\n  pages={234--249},\r\n  year={2015},\r\n  publisher={SAGE Publications Sage UK: London, England}\r\n}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Empirical Guidance on Scatterplot and Dimension Reduction Technique Choices","Submission Target":"TVCG","Date":"2013-10-16","Type":"","First Author":"Michael Sedlmair","Other Authors":"Tamara Munzner, Melanie Tory","Key (e.g. for file names)":"sedlmair2013infovis","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.153","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2013/ScatterplotEval/","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"To verify cluster separation in high-dimensional data, analysts often reduce the data with a dimension reduction (DR) technique, and then visualize it with 2D Scatterplots, interactive 3D Scatterplots, or Scatterplot Matrices (SPLOMs). With the goal of providing guidance between these visual encoding choices, we conducted an empirical data study in which two human coders manually inspected a broad set of 816 scatterplots derived from 75 datasets, 4 DR techniques, and the 3 previously mentioned scatterplot techniques. Each coder scored all color-coded classes in each scatterplot in terms of their separability from other classes. We analyze the resulting quantitative data with a heatmap approach, and qualitatively discuss interesting scatterplot examples. Our findings reveal that 2D scatterplots are often 'good enough', that is, neither SPLOM nor interactive 3D adds notably more cluster separability with the chosen DR technique. If 2D is not good enough, the most promising approach is to use an alternative DR technique in 2D. Beyond that, SPLOM occasionally adds additional value, and interactive 3D rarely helps but often hurts in terms of poorer class separation and usability. We summarize these results as a workflow model and implications for design.

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.","bibtex":"@ARTICLE{6634108,\r\n  author={Isenberg, Tobias and Isenberg, Petra and Chen, Jian and Sedlmair, Michael and Möller, Torsten},\r\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, \r\n  title={A Systematic Review on the Practice of Evaluating Visualization}, \r\n  year={2013},\r\n  volume={19},\r\n  number={12},\r\n  pages={2818-2827},\r\n  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2013.126}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"ParaGlide: Interactive Parameter Space Partitioning for Computer Simulations","Submission Target":"TVCG","Date":"2013-03-07","Type":"","First Author":"Steven Bergner","Other Authors":"Michael Sedlmair, Torsten Möller, Sareh Nabi Abdolyousefi, Ahmed Saad","Key (e.g. for file names)":"bergner2013tvcg","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.61","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"In this paper, we introduce ParaGlide, a visualization system designed for interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multidimensional simulation models.

Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.","bibtex":"@ARTICLE{6327248,\r\n  author={Sedlmair, Michael and Meyer, Miriah and Munzner, Tamara},\r\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, \r\n  title={Design Study Methodology: Reflections from the Trenches and the Stacks}, \r\n  year={2012},\r\n  volume={18},\r\n  number={12},\r\n  pages={2431-2440},\r\n  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2012.213}}\r\n","Notes":"Honorable Mention for Best Paper Award","Funding":""},{"Title":"RelEx: Visualization for Actively Changing Overlay Network Specifications","Submission Target":"TVCG","Date":"2012-10-09","Type":"","First Author":"Michael Sedlmair","Other Authors":"Annika Frank, Tamara Munzner, Andreas Butz","Key (e.g. for file names)":"sedlmair2012infovis-2","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.255","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2012/RelEx/","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"We present a network visualization design study focused on supporting automotive engineers who need to specify and optimize traffic patterns for in-car communication networks.

Storing and accessing our listening histories is trivial due to services like Last.fm, but learning from them and understanding them is not. Existing solutions operate at a very abstract level and only produce statistics. By applying techniques from information visualization to this problem, we were able to provide average people with a detailed and powerful tool for accessing their own musical past. LastHistory is an interactive visualization for displaying music listening histories, along with contextual information from personal photos and calendar entries. Its two main user tasks are (1) analysis, with an emphasis on temporal patterns and hypotheses related to musical genre and sequences, and (2) reminiscing, where listening histories and context represent part of one's past. In this design study paper we give an overview of the field of music listening histories and explain their unique characteristics as a type of personal data. We then describe the design rationale, data and view transformations of LastHistory and present the results from both a laband a large-scale online study. We also put listening histories in contrast to other lifelogging data. The resonant and enthusiastic feedback that we received from average users shows a need for making their personal data accessible.

The explosion of data worldwide affects nearly every part of society, particularly the science, engineering, health, and financial domains. Looking, for instance at the automotive industry, engineers are confronted with the enormously increased complexity of vehicle electronics. Over the years, a large number of advanced functions, such as ACC (adaptive cruise control), rear seat entertainment systems or automatic start/stop engines, has been integrated into the vehicle. Thereby, the functions have been more and more distributed over the vehicle, leading to the introduction of several communication networks. Overlooking all relevant data facets, understanding dependencies, analyzing the flow of messages and tracking down problems in these networks has become a major challenge for automotive engineers.  \r\n\r\nPromising approaches to overcome information overload and to provide insight into complex data are Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Visual Analytics (VA). Over the last decades, these research communities spent much effort on developing new methods to help users obtain insight into complex data. However, few of these solutions have yet reached end users, and moving research into practice remains one of the great challenges in visual data analysis. This situation is particularly true for large company settings, where very little is known about additional challenges, obstacles and requirements in InfoVis/VA development and evaluation. Users have to be better integrated into our research processes in terms of adequate requirements analysis, understanding practices and challenges, developing well-directed, user-centered technologies and evaluating their value within a realistic context.  \r\n\r\nThis dissertation explores a novel InfoVis/VA application area, namely in-car communication networks, and demonstrates how information visualization methods and techniques can help engineers to work with and better understand these networks. Based on a three-year internship with a large automotive company and the close cooperation with domain experts, I grounded a profound understanding of specific challenges, requirements and obstacles for InfoVis/VA application in this area and learned that “designing with not for the people” is highly important for successful solutions. The three main contributions of this dissertation are: (1) An empirical analysis of current working practices of automotive engineers and the derivation of specific design requirements for InfoVis/VA tools; (2) the successful application and evaluation of nine prototypes, including the deployment of five systems; and (3) based on the three-year experience, a set of recommendations for developing and evaluating InfoVis systems in large company settings.\r\n\r\nI present ethnographic studies with more than 150 automotive engineers. These studies helped us to understand currently used tools, the underlying data, tasks as well as user groups and to categorize the field into application sub-domains. Based on these findings, we propose implications and recommendations for designing tools to support current practices of automotive network engineers with InfoVis/VA technologies. I also present nine InfoVis design studies that we built and evaluated with automotive domain experts and use them to systematically explore the design space of applying InfoVis to in-car communication networks. Each prototype was developed in a user-centered, participatory process, respectively with a focus on a specific sub-domain of target users with specific data and tasks. Experimental results from studies with real users are presented, that show that the visualization prototypes can improve the engineers’ work in terms of working efficiency, better understanding and novel insights. Based on lessons learned from repeatedly designing and evaluating our tools together with domain experts at a large automotive company, I discuss challenges and present recommendations for deploying and evaluating VA/InfoVis tools in large company settings. I hope that these recommendations can guide other InfoVis researchers and practitioners in similar projects by providing them with new insights, such as the necessity for close integration with current tools and given processes, distributed knowledge and high degree of specialization, and the importance of addressing prevailing mental models and time restrictions. In general, I think that large company settings are a promising and fruitful field for novel InfoVis applications and expect our recommendations to be useful tools for other researchers and tool designers.","bibtex":"@thesis{ediss12448,\r\n           month = {October},\r\n           title = {Visual Analysis of In-Car Communication Networks},\r\n            year = {2010},\r\n          author = {Michael Sedlmair},\r\n       publisher = {Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit{\\\"a}t M{\\\"u}nchen},\r\n             url = {http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:19-124488},\r\n        keywords = {Visualization, Visual Analytics, Automotive, In-Car Networks}\r\n}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Evaluating Information Visualization in Large Companies: Challenges, Experiences and Recommendations ","Submission Target":"CHI BELIV","Date":"2010-04-10","Type":"Workshop Paper","First Author":"Michael Sedlmair","Other Authors":"Petra Isenberg, Dominikus Baur, Andreas Butz","Key (e.g. for file names)":"sedlmair2010beliv","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2110192.2110204","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"We examine the process and some implications of evaluating information visualization in a large company setting.

In order to help engineers to detect and analyze the potential sources and consequences of errors, it is crucial to provide both comprehensive and detailed insight into the communication processes and their contexts. Two important aspects of these are the dependencies and correlations between onboard functions. In this paper we present a dual-view visualization for exploring the functional dependency chains of in-car communication processes. One view presents the dependencies of hardware components using a space filling approach similar to a treemap, whereas the other view displays the functional correlations as an interactive sequence chart. The views are coupled via color coding and show the dependencies of an interactively selectable functional unit. In an expert evaluation, we assessed the benefits of using this visualization technique for in-car communication diagnostics with very positive results.","bibtex":"@INPROCEEDINGS{4577941,\r\n  author={Sedlmair, Michael and Hintermaier, Wolfgang and Stocker, Konrad and Büring, Thorsten and Butz, Andreas},\r\n  booktitle={2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation}, \r\n  title={A Dual-View Visualization of In-Car Communication Processes}, \r\n  year={2008},\r\n  pages={157-162},\r\n  doi={10.1109/IV.2008.20}}\r\n","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"LibViz: Data Visualisation of the Old Library ","Submission Target":"VSMM","Date":"2008-00-00","Type":"","First Author":"Kerstin Ruhland","Other Authors":"Susan Bioletti, Michael Sedlmair, Carol O'Sullivan","Key (e.g. for file names)":"ruhland2008vsmm","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"","bibtex":"","Notes":"Best Paper Award","Funding":""},{"Title":"Requirements for a MDE System to Support Collaborative In-Car Communication Diagnostics","Submission Target":"International CSCW Workshop Beyond the Laboratory","Date":"2008-00-00","Type":"Workshop Paper","First Author":"Michael Sedlmair","Other Authors":"Dominikus Baur, Sebastian Boring, Petra Isenberg, Marko Jurmu, Andreas Butz","Key (e.g. for file names)":"sedlmair2008cscw","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"MSCar: Enhancing Message Sequence Charts with Interactivity for Analysing (Automotive) Communication Sequences","Submission Target":"Workshop on the Layout of (Software) Engineering Diagrams (LED)","Date":"2008-00-00","Type":"Workshop Paper","First Author":"Michael Sedlmair","Other Authors":"","Key (e.g. for file names)":"sedlmair2008led","Publisher URL (official)":"https://doi.org/10.14279/tuj.eceasst.13.170","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a standardized and widespread form to visually describe interactions in distributed systems. Our approach proposes the enrichment of large scaled MSCs with novel interaction and design techniques used in the field of information visualization. Additionally, we show a graphical solution to visualize parallel, multi-directed communication processes in MSCs. Instead of the common application to specify system behaviours our interactive MSCs are aimed at exploring and diagnosing dependencies in network communication in general and, regarding our special requirements, within in-car communication traces. We implemented a prototype called MSCar with Focus and Context techniques, Dynamic Path Highlighting, Details on Demand and Colour Coding to support the users' cognitive abilities. A qualitative user study on MSCar gave us\r\npreliminary feedback and disclosed potentials of our approach.","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""},{"Title":"Methoden der Informationsvisualisierung für Kommunikationsprozesse im Fahrzeug ","Submission Target":"Diplom Thesis, University of Munich","Date":"","Type":"","First Author":"Michael Sedlmair","Other Authors":"","Key (e.g. for file names)":"sedlmair2007da","Publisher URL (official)":"","PDF URL (public)":"","Video":"","Supplemental":"","Acknowledgements":"","Abstract":"","bibtex":"","Notes":"","Funding":""}]
